As with all my other torrents, once this becomes fully seeded, I will no longer be able to support the torrent.  So if you download this today, please consider holding onto, and sharing it back a little longer than you might otherwise would.\n\nA special note of thanks to zarkann1 who recently posted &quot;Such a great compilation! Moriah Peters song is giving me goose bumps&quot; in one of my other threads.  That's exactly why I devote so much of my time and energy to sharing this type of music.  In hopes that it will become a blessing in someone's life, and God becomes rightfully glorified through it.\n\n\nThe 34 new titles in this 7th bundle includes\n\n * Alexa Willis - 2012 - You Are His - Single\n * Ali Rozet - 2012 - The Abolition\n * All Sons And Daughters - 2012 - Season One\n * Applejaxx - 2012 - Organic\n * Ashley Nelson - 2012 - Selah - Single\n * Before Their Eyes - 2012 - Redemption\n * Bethel College Chapel Band - 2012 - Love Came Down\n * Bloodline Severed - 2012 - Letters To Decapolis\n * Bobby Tinsley - 2012 - Difference - Single\n * Born From The Sea - 2012 - Born From The Sea\n * Chris Lee Cobbins - 2012 - Get Well Soon\n * Cory Lamb - 2012 - Safe In Your Arms EP\n * Creature Clan - 2012 - New Beginnings\n * Dillon Chase - 2012 - Speak Up\n * DJ Cmd - 2012 - Dance 53 - New Story\n * Fike - 2012 - Wait - Single\n * Highpoint Church - 2012 - Live To Love\n * Impending Doom - 2012 - Baptized In Filth\n * Jacob Thomas - 2012 - Footsteps\n * Jars of Clay - 2012 - Spring Tour Sampler\n * Justin Kintzel - 2012 - Death Is Overcome\n * Kelsey Hicks - 2012 - Limitless\n * Lights Go Down - 2012 - Sarah - Single\n * Matt Long - 2012 - Freedom - Single\n * Nicole Croteau - 2012 - Anchors And Silhouettes\n * Point Of Grace - 2012 - A Thousand Little Things - Single\n * Sarah Macintosh - 2012 - Current\n * Scooda - 2012 - Out The Box\n * Sev Statik And Vinylcologist - 2012 - Sinderblock EP\n * Switchfoot - 2012 - Live At John Perkins Benefit EP\n * T-Juan - 2012 - Agape - The Love Tape\n * TNED - 2012 - The Mind Of A Geneus\n * True Story - 2012 - Building Blocks\n * William Joseph - 2012 - Be Still\n\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - March 2012\n\n\nDetails of all six torrents can be found in the thread further below...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fafc0aea90618e46e28e005b8951ad1d8ce7b39","amp;dn":"2012+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+07+of+07%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fafc0aea90618e46e28e005b8951ad1d8ce7b39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,175,192,174,169,6,24,228,110,40,224,5,184,149,26,209,216,206,123,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
