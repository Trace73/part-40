One of the book's peculiarities is that the Zapruder film was not in common distribution as it is now, so Thompson had to employ an artist to recreate the frames. Yet despite its being almost 50 years out of date the book is still an essential read, and most subsequent JFK books borrow from it freely.\n\nThis is considered a classic study on the JFK Assassination. It sells for over $200 on Amazon, if you can find a copy. Finally found this scanned PDF version online on a private tracker, thought it should be here. Enjoy......\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce9c1406969791e27e3133550312f2af08d0dc8c","amp;dn":"Six+Seconds+in+Dallas+%28JFK+Assassination%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce9c1406969791e27e3133550312f2af08d0dc8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,156,20,6,150,151,145,226,126,49,51,85,3,18,242,175,8,208,220,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
