Gonsalves would pass away within a year and Eldridge would only be able to play for about five more. Actually, Eldridge is in generally good (and typically combative) form on tunes such as his &quot;5400 North&quot; and &quot;C Jam Blues.&quot; The ailing Gonsalves is tentative and streaky in spots and just average throughout despite his best efforts. The rhythm section (pianist Cliff Smalls, bassist Sam Jones and drummer Eddie Locke) is perfectly up to the task and has &quot;It's the Talk of the Town&quot; as its feature. It's an interesting historical album although the leader has sounded much better elsewhere. ~ Scott Yanow Recorded in August 1973. Personnel: Paul Gonsalves, Roy Eldridge, Cliff Smalls, Sam Jones, Eddie Locke.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d85d3d862774f5814cc48920e1c3672124ea2ae","amp;dn":"Paul+Gonsalves%2C+Roy+Eldridge+-+Mexican+Bandit+Meets+Pittsburgh+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d85d3d862774f5814cc48920e1c3672124ea2ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,133,211,216,98,119,79,88,20,204,72,146,14,28,54,114,18,78,162,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
