Promotional info - &quot;The acclaimed Ghost Rider run of writer Jason Aaron reaches its fever-pitched conclusion with six issues of insanity, all jam-packed with new villains, old allies, and the same old grindhouse action that Flamehead fans have come to know and love. The renegade angel Zadkiel is out to thwart Biblical prophecy by assassinating a young boy bred by Satanists to rule the world, so if Ghost Riders Johnny Blaze and Danny Ketch are going to save the world, they'll first have to save the Anti-Christ. Guest-starring Hellstorm, the Son of Satan.&quot; \n\nI have provided a link to the series itself in the comments section below; it is suggested that you read that first for maximum comprehension of this mini. Please seed and enjoy, thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c80373eb7d4e261a02c4bfa2ccab997b6bddcb5e","amp;dn":"Ghost+Riders+-+Heaven%27s+On+Fire+01-06+%282009-2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c80373eb7d4e261a02c4bfa2ccab997b6bddcb5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,3,115,235,125,78,38,26,2,196,191,162,204,171,153,123,107,221,203,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
