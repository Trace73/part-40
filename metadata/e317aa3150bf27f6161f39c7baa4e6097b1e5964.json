Starring Ahn Gil Gang and Kim Seon Jae, Time Between Dog and Wolf follows the journey of two protagonists who bear the pain of parting from their family members after the Korean War. The film depicts the experiences of many war-displaced people as they search for their lost identities and a sense of place in a world surprisingly still ridden with the scars of war. Its title, Time Between Dog and Wolf, comes from a French expression referring to the time at dusk when darkness begins to fall making it difficult to distinguish dogs from wolves, and it alludes to the fine line that exists between one's definition of hope and fear.\n\nBurdened with seemingly insurmountable debt, film director Kim (Ahn Gil Gang) breaks into a cold sweat every time the phone rings. To get away from the daily torment, he travels back to his hometown of Sokcho, a town with many war displaced victims. Though half a century has gone by since the war, reminders of pain and loss still exist in every corner of the street. There, Kim meets a woman named Young Wha (Kim Seon Jae), who is looking aimlessly for her long-lost sibling. A strange sense of hope creeps into their hearts as the two journey together in search of their past.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0003.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0003.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0008.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0008.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0013.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0013.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0029.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0029.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0024.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0024.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0028.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i279.photobucket.com/albums/kk121/EceAyhan/ALBUM2/shot0028.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----not my rip----\nI would have gone with a higher video bitrate and lower audio\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..........................: 1,466,232,832\nRuntime ...........................................: 1:49:09\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.0.1\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x384 (AR: 1.85)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1333 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.206 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC..............: [B-VOP], [P-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ....................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 448 kb/s tot , 6 chnls (3/2 .1) CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
