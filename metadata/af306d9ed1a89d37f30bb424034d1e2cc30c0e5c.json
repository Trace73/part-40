The hackers who formed the underground were not disgruntled computer professionals or gangs of organised criminals. They were disaffected teenagers who used their basic home computers to explore the embryonic Internet from inside their locked, suburban bedrooms. From this shadowy world emerged two elite hackers known as Electron and Phoenix, who formed part of an alliance called The Realm.\n\nTogether, Electron and Phoenix stole a restricted computer security list and used it to break into some of the world's most classified and supposedly secure computer systems. So fast and widespread was the attack, people assumed it was an automated program, until Phoenix called The New York Times to brag. Soon the US Secret Service and the FBI were on their trail and, within months, the Australian Federal Police had raided their homes.\n\nUsing a combination of interviews and dramatic reconstructions, In the Realm of the Hackers charts ElectronÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s journey from his initial innocent explorations to his ultimate obsession. It vividly recreates the climate of the 1980s, before there was public access to the Internet.\n\nIn the Realm of the Hackers takes us headlong into the clandestine, risky but intoxicating world of the computer underground to uncover not only how the hackers did it but why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErnie Gray\t.......:     Electron's father\nNathan Phillips\t.......:     Phoenix\nDan Spielman\t.......:     Electron\nRonald Tencati\t.......:     Ronald Tencati\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduced by: Franco di Chiera\n=============================\n\nWritten &amp; directed by: Kevin Anderson\n=====================================\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    In The Realm Of The Hackers\nYear.................:    2003\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:56:08\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    128 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    MPEG Layer-3\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    576x320\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    873 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    N/A\nFile Size:...........:    350 MB\nFPS..................:    25.000000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    29/5/2003\n\n\n\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1199631/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1199631/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit&quot; Suprbay Forum&quot; at this \nlink: --------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the &quot;nfo&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                         **** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ****\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af306d9ed1a89d37f30bb424034d1e2cc30c0e5c","amp;dn":"In+The+Realm+Of+The+Hackers-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af306d9ed1a89d37f30bb424034d1e2cc30c0e5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,48,109,158,209,168,157,55,243,11,180,36,3,77,30,44,195,12,14,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
