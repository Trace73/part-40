These cues were taken from game files [excluding the songs because a true score is pure score and not an OST]. I wasn\\'t able to extract the music which is played during the cinematics, because some dumb fuck from Interplay mixed it with sound [and there is no way of getting it out in a convinient way]. If somehow you do have these few additional short tracks- plese, post a link to them in comments\n\n===============================================================================\n\nThis is not the Vault Archives version from 2010 [remastered by a \\&quot;professional\\&quot;, who in a mather of fact did a rather shitty job on most of the tracks]. All of the titles are taken from games\n\n===============================================================================\n\nI\\'ve semi-remastered all of the tracks by adjusting the volume or making them lauder where it needed to be done [fuck the dynamics!]. And that\\'s without sound quality lost because I did not use some quick automatic normalization option but instead of that I used my senses and expierience. I have also cleaned the tracks from any clicks / pops / pitches / glitches that would have been otherwise hearable on moderate volume on speakers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:952c01d9f05aa83c76df8c3a5d74fb1a77286981","amp;dn":"Fallout+%2F+Fallout+2+Remastered+Score","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"952c01d9f05aa83c76df8c3a5d74fb1a77286981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,44,1,217,240,90,168,60,118,223,140,58,93,116,251,26,119,40,105,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
