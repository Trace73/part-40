Lets take a closer look!\n\n01 we share the same dreams\n02 sliding sh\n03 daybreak\n04 angel dust\n05 understated\n06 culture is not your friend\n07 excession\n08 deun deu\n09 the only life weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve known\n10 lost in the woods\n11 crystal vision\n12 opal fountain\n13 how does it feel to be real. \n  \nThe album starts with a short spherical pad intro. Then the second track delivers a big surprise: A continuous beat and pretty straight percussion make it quite danceable. Yes, I can imagine this sound pretty well on an after hour that moments when your head wants to relax a little but your feet still want to keep moving... My impression is confirmed by the next track: Definitely dance music! The tracks have a very warm atmosphere, a very positive and also relaxed mood. But powerful baselines and considerable percussion elements animate to move your limbs. All together a very trancy mood evolves, as I already mentioned perfect sound for later party hours or a sunny meadow during a shiny summer day. I already knew that Russell Davies aka Abakus is able to produce cool dance orientated tracks, for instance I remember a nice vinyl on Dragonfly records. But nevertheless I am very surprised by this new album which might have to do with the fact the last one is one of my all time favorites and this one is really different.\n  \nConcerning the production quality the album is definitely official, especially the basses provide a wonderful deepness and the dreamy melodies have a very characteristic flavor. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe share the same dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a variating album in the end, the majority of the tracks are danceable with lots of beats and percussion but there are also some rather chilly, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œclose-your-eyes-and-fly-awayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tracks on the album. All together 13 tracks deliver good value for money!\n  \nAt the beginning of this review I asked, if the new Abakus album can measure with the last one. Now I have to say: This was the wrong question, because ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe share the same dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is really different and therefore the albums are hard to compare with each other. I just can say that this album is a sophisticated release, both from the ideas it includes and the production quality. Abakus' style has evolved and that is a feature not all artists have today...  a thing I really do respect! I myself liked ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat much closer to the sunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ even better, but as said: That is kind of different story. \n\nArtwork included all 320kps please seed this as much as you can so others can enjoy as well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ce7c504958d3a9850f8d0f7d8c4caae1291e90f","amp;dn":"Abakus+We+Share+the+Same+Dreams","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ce7c504958d3a9850f8d0f7d8c4caae1291e90f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,231,197,4,149,141,58,152,80,248,208,247,216,196,202,174,18,145,233,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
