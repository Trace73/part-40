They barely affected the daily routine of the civilian population, yet for the leaders of the opposing houses of York and Lancaster, the wars were devastating. First hand accounts reveal how the lives of their women and children were blighted during three decades of war, as many of their male relatives met with violent deaths. This book examines in detail the causes, course and results of each of the main wars and concludes with a fascinating insight into why the wars ended so abruptly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c96063744685dca17e20937aabf7e8f2cc117f2","amp;dn":"The+War+of+the+Roses%3A+1455-1485+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c96063744685dca17e20937aabf7e8f2cc117f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,150,6,55,68,104,93,202,23,226,9,55,170,191,126,143,44,193,23,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
