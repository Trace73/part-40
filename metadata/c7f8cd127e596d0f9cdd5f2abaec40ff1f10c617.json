Is alien contact a reality that has always been with us? If so, what worlds do these beings come from, and why?\n\nDr Jacques Vallee is certain that the UFO phenomenon has existed at least since the beginning of recorded history. Overturning conventional theories and changing our whole perspective, this internationally respected scientist examines accounts of UFO sightings and contacts from Biblical time up to the present day, pointing out the remarkable consistency in reports separated by thousands of miles and hundreds of years.\n\nOne of the world&amp;#039;s most distinguished UFO investigators, who served as the real-life model for the French scientist played by Francois Truffaut in Steven Spielberg&amp;#039;s classic film, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Dr Vallee&amp;#039;s cool scientific appraisal leads him to startling conclusions. We may ignore them at our peril.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7f8cd127e596d0f9cdd5f2abaec40ff1f10c617","amp;dn":"Jacques+Vallee+-+Dimensions%3A+A+Casebook+of+Alien+Contacts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7f8cd127e596d0f9cdd5f2abaec40ff1f10c617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,248,205,18,126,89,109,15,156,221,95,42,186,236,64,255,31,16,198,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
