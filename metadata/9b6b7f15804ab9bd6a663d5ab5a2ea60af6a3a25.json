China starts its world domination by conquering Mongolia and Kazakhstan. Maria Kimalov, the heroine, escapes Kazakhstan after nearly being killed by a terrorist by the name of Ivan Markov. Markov is working with the communists to take over the world, and Maria was on the verge of ruining his plans. She flees to America where she hopes to start a new life, but she can't unless she enlists in the Marine Corps. With the war raging in Asia, she must face two of her worse nightmares: the secret she keeps from her Marine comrades and the possibility of intercepting Markov.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b6b7f15804ab9bd6a663d5ab5a2ea60af6a3a25","amp;dn":"Maria+Marine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b6b7f15804ab9bd6a663d5ab5a2ea60af6a3a25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,107,127,21,128,74,185,189,106,102,61,90,181,162,234,96,175,106,58,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
