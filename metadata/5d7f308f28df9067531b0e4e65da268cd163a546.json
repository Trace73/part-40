He remembers how Gaara insulted him; how weak he was and his lack of hatred. He envies Naruto, as Naruto is growing stronger than him. At some point, he receives a message saying that Itachi has came to the village and he was after Naruto. At the inn, he found Itachi, his partner and Naruto (but doesn't know what the two were doing there). Itachi greets his little brother. Sasuke says that he will kill Itachi, and Kisame notices his Sharingan, and asks Itachi who he was. Itachi simply answers that he was his little brother. Naruto is shocked on hearing this and realises that Itachi is the man Sasuke wants to kill. Sasuke attacks his brother with his Chidori, but Itachi easily blocks his attack. Kisame was ready to cut Naruto's arm, but is interrupted by Jiraiya. At the Konoha Hospital, Sasuke remembers what Itachi said to him. Sakura offers him an apple, but he throws it away. He challenges Naruto, to which Naruto happily accepts. The battle begins but Kakashi intervenes. Sasuke is once again surprised by Naruto's power. That night, Sasuke is ambushed by Orochimaru's bodyguards, the Sound Four, who invite him to join Orochimaru and gain more power.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d7f308f28df9067531b0e4e65da268cd163a546","amp;dn":"%5BM%40nI%5D+Naruto+Shippuden%2FShippuuden+259+720p+%28Dual+Audio%29+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d7f308f28df9067531b0e4e65da268cd163a546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,127,48,143,40,223,144,103,83,27,14,78,101,218,38,140,209,99,165,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
