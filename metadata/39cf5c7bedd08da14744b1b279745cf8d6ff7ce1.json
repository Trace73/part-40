The owner of a remarkable four-and-a-half-octave vocal range, he employed idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist lyrics, and an unholy alliance of free jazz, Delta blues, latter-day classical music, and rock &amp; roll to create a singular body of work virtually unrivaled in its daring and fluid creativity. While he never came even remotely close to mainstream success, Beefheart's impact was incalculable, and his fingerprints were all over punk, new wave, and post-rock. \n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFLAC Lossless\nLabel:\t\t\tNot On Label\nCatalog:\t\tMK 42532\nAudiochecker:\t\t99.81% CDDA\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Tropical Hot Dog Night\n02.Nowadays A Woman`s Gotta Hit A Man\n03.Owed T' Alex\n04.Dropout Boogie\n05.Hairy Irene\n06.Abba Zaba\n07.Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles\n08.Old Fart At Play\n09.Well\n10.Ice Rose\n11.The Floppy Boot Stomp\n12.You Know You're A Man\n13.When I See Mommy, I Feel Like A Mummy\n14.Veteran's Day Poppy\n15.Safe As Milk\n16.Suction Prints\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cf5c7bedd08da14744b1b279745cf8d6ff7ce1","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart+-+Live+At+My+Father%27s+Place+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cf5c7bedd08da14744b1b279745cf8d6ff7ce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,207,92,123,237,208,141,161,71,68,177,178,121,116,92,248,214,255,124,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
