The album was hailed by The Independent's Andy Gill who claimed that New Order's ninth outing 'actually bests its parent album [Waiting for the Sirens' Call].' Gill particularly recommended I Told You So, Sugarcane and Hellbent as the album's better tracks. Metro stated the album 'offers few classics but will still delight fans of the band with its feelgood sound.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f2660189c22a837778ef92691484f2c8b81ab6","amp;dn":"New+Order+-+Lost+Sirens+%28PLEASE+SEED+to+2.0+Ratio%21%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f2660189c22a837778ef92691484f2c8b81ab6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,242,102,1,137,194,42,131,119,120,239,146,105,20,132,242,200,184,26,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
