It is rather a free adaptation of available subtitles of the movie found on Internet intertwined with subtitles of the 1979 remake of the film by Werner Herzog. \n\t\nAs the title suggests this subtitle is meant for a certain ritual of watching Murnau's movie, which is at night and on a flight arriving at a certain destination. However, this subtitle is carefully recommended for other nocturnal journeys reaching the destination before dawn. *****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ac7e664c8b96c5609aa346c04d86bbaa3e80dc5","amp;dn":"Nosferatu+%281922%29+English+subtitle+%5BRead+The+Description+First%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ac7e664c8b96c5609aa346c04d86bbaa3e80dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,199,230,100,200,185,108,86,9,170,52,108,4,216,107,186,163,232,13,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
