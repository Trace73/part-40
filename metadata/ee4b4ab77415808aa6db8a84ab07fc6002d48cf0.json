A knowledge of the main equations and of the methods for analyzing them is therefore essential to every working physical scientist and engineer. Andrea Prosperetti draws on many years' research experience to produce a guide to a wide variety of methods, ranging from classical Fourier-type series through to the theory of distributions and basic functional analysis. Theorems are stated precisely and their meaning explained, though proofs are mostly only sketched, with comments and examples being given more prominence. The book structure does not require sequential reading: each chapter is self-contained and users can fashion their own path through the material. Topics are first introduced in the context of applications, and later complemented by a more thorough presentation.\nBook Description\nAndrea Prosperetti draws on many years' experience at the forefront of research to produce a guide to the mathematical methods needed for classical fields. Each chapter is essentially self-contained, so users can fashion their own path through the material according to their needs. \n\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 742 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (6 Jan 2011)\n# Language English\n# ISBN-10: 0521735874\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521735872","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4b4ab77415808aa6db8a84ab07fc6002d48cf0","amp;dn":"Advanced+Mathematics+for+Applications+%5BBBS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4b4ab77415808aa6db8a84ab07fc6002d48cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,75,74,183,116,21,128,138,166,219,138,132,171,7,252,96,2,212,140,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
