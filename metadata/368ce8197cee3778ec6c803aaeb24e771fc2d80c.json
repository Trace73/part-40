Stossel also challenges the assumed notions about organic foods: that it's more environmentally friendly, that it produces a better, more sustainable, and cleaner product (not to mention better tasting). Does it really?\n\n(Uploader's note: Not addressed is the idea that a hefty dose of plain fraud may exist in the organic/natural foods industry, where &quot;green&quot; marketing takes center-stage while the true nature of the product getting the organic or enviro-special labeling may not be much more than repackaged foodstuffs from mainstream supply chains.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:368ce8197cee3778ec6c803aaeb24e771fc2d80c","amp;dn":"20101118-Stossel-%5BFood+Fight%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"368ce8197cee3778ec6c803aaeb24e771fc2d80c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,140,232,25,124,238,55,120,236,108,128,58,174,178,78,119,31,194,216,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
