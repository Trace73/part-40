The album was produced by Colin Linden and featured some of Nashville's most storied players including Spooner Oldham (Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Neil Young) on keyboards, Charlie McCoy (Bob Dylan, Elvis, Simon &amp; Garfunkel) on harmonica, Dave Roe (Johnny Cash, John Mellencamp) on acoustic bass, Chris Donahue (Emmylou Harris, Robert Plant) on electric bass, Bryan Owings (Emmylou Harris, Tony Joe White, Delbert McClinton) on drums, along with producer Linden (Bruce Cockburn, Lucinda Williams) on electric guitars and vocals. The record was brilliantly recorded by John Whynot (Blue Rodeo, Loreena McKennitt) who also contributed keyboards on a few songs. The recording features 10 new Joe Nolan compositions and shows a quantum leap in maturity and confidence. Joe's beautiful combination of sweet, sad lyrics and haunting vocals come from a deep well that shows a young man's heart and an old man's soul. Protest songs, love songs, songs with questions and songs with answers create a collection that will leave the listener wanting more.
