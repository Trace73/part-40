Council's major claim to fame is that his first name was taken by Syd Barrett and combined with the first name of another bluesman, Pink Anderson, to make the moniker Pink Floyd, although the British group has never had much, if anything, in common with East Coast blues. Richard and Welly Trice aren't a performing duo, and their selections feature each of them playing separately, with Welly emerging as the more interesting of the two. The real treat here may well be the eight tracks by Eddie Kelly's Washboard Band, a jug band-like ensemble featuring harmonica, kazoo, acoustic guitar, and washboard. The sheer messy joy in the group's playing makes the band a complete delight. ~ Steve Leggett, All Music Guide\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Runaway Man Blues , Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council   2:53 \nRecorded: New York City,  9 Febuary 1937[/size]\n\n\n\n2 I'm Grievin' and I'm Worryin' , Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council  2:46 \nRecorded: New York City, 9 Febuary, 1937\n\n3 I Don't Want No Hungry Woman , Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council   2:46  \nRecorded New York City,9  Febuary 1937\n(Released on Bull City Blues with Blind Boy Fuller)\n\n4 Working Man Blues , Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council   3:04 \nRecorded: New York City, 11 Febuary 1937\n\n5 Poor and Ain't Got a Dime, Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council   3:02 \nRecorded: New York City,11 Febuary 1937\n\n6 Lookin' for My Baby , Floyd &quot;Dipper Boy&quot; Council   2:58 \nRecorded: New York City, 11 Febuary 1937\n\n\nEddie Kelly, Washboard Band\n\n7 Goin' Back to Alabama   2:34 \n8 Blues in the Rain   2:31 \n9 Poole County Blues    3:02  \n10 If You Think I'm Loving You, You're Wrong    2:59 \n11 Corina, I'm Goin' Away   2:53 \n12 Shim Shamin'   3:07 \n13 Come on 'Round to My House, Baby  3:12 \n14 Come on 'Round to My House, Baby  3:11 \n\nWillie Trice &amp; Richard Trice\n\n15  Come On In Here Mama    3:15 \nRecorded  13 July 1937 in New York City; Willie Trice, voc, g &amp; Richard Trice, g\n16  Let Her Go, God Bless Her  3:12 \nRecorded  13 July 1937 in New York City; Willie Trice, voc, g &amp; Richard Trice, g\n17  Come On Baby   2:51 \nRecorded: 13 July 1937 in New York City; Richard Trice, voc, g\n18  Trembling Bed Springs Blues 2:48 ]\nRecorded: 13 July 1937 in New York City; Richard Trice, voc, g\n19   Shake Your Stuff  2:40\nRecorded: 22 October  1946 in New York; Richard Trice, voc, g\n20  Lazy Bug Blues   2:19 \nRecorded: 22 October  1946 in New York; Richard Trice, voc, g\n21  Bed Spring Blues   2:47 \n22  Pack It Up and Go  2:45 \n23  Blood Red River Blues  2:35 \n24   Down-Hearted Man, 2:43 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:548c47fb07359122f5bc3e90bd62d50550208923","amp;dn":"Carolina+Blues+1937-1947+The+Complete+Recorded+Works+of+Floyd+Co","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"548c47fb07359122f5bc3e90bd62d50550208923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,140,71,251,7,53,145,34,245,188,62,144,189,98,213,5,80,32,137,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
