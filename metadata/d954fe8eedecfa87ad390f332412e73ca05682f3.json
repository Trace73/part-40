If the product is found, the GUI should display that productÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s information in the GUI.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe application has four well-commented files:\n\n1. InventoryPart6.java ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ contains the GUI and the main() method\n\n2. Computer.java ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ represents the product manipulated by the application\n\n3. Supplier.java ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ extends Computer\n\n4. Logo.java ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a JPanel extension which paints the company logo.\n\n\nThis is the exact package that IT Martins sells for $20.  Use it for your final project in IT/215\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d954fe8eedecfa87ad390f332412e73ca05682f3","amp;dn":"Java+Inventory+Program+Part+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d954fe8eedecfa87ad390f332412e73ca05682f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,84,254,142,237,236,250,135,173,57,15,51,36,18,231,60,160,86,130,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
