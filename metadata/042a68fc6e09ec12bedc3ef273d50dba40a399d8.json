If only the brothers had normal parents, not a scientist mother and a father who experiments with space and time travel. If only the Murry twins had noticed the note on the door of their mother's lab:  Experiment In Progress. Please Keep Out\n\nAmazon.com Review\n\nWe've all done it. In the frigid depths of winter we've wished we could be magically transported to someplace warm and sunny. But most people don't have genius parents who just happen to be working on a scientific experiment with time travel at the moment of our wish. Sandy and Dennys Murry, the &quot;normal&quot; boys in a family of geniuses, suddenly find themselves trudging through a blazing-hot desert, seeking a far-off oasis for shade. Their desperate wandering brings them face-to-face with history--biblical history. Soon they're feeling right at home with Noah and his family. Even so, the urgent question is, how will Sandy and Dennys get back to their own place and time before the floods--the many waters--come? As they begin to cross the invisible border into adulthood, the twins must confront their ability to resist temptation and embrace integrity.\n\nIn Many Waters, Madeleine L'Engle continues the Murry family saga, which includes A Wrinkle in Time; A Wind in the Door; and A Swiftly Tilting Planet, which won the American Book Award. L'Engle's mystical mix of science fiction and fantasy, time and space travel, history, morals, religion, and culture once again urges her many adoring readers to stretch their minds and hearts to understand why the world is the way it is.\n-Emilie Coulter\n\nThis is the fourth book in the Time Quartet series by Madeleine L'Engle.\n\n00 - Intro\n01 - Chapter 01 - Virtual Particles and Virtual Unicorns\n02 - Chapter 02 - Pelican in the Wilderness\n03 - Chapter 03 - Japheth's Sister Yalith\n04 - Chapter 04 - Grandfather Lamech and Grandfather Enoch\n05 - Chapter 05 - The Nephilim\n06 - Chapter 06 - Adnarel and the Quantum Leap\n07 - Chapter 07 - The Seraphim\n08 - Chapter 08 - Oholibama.
