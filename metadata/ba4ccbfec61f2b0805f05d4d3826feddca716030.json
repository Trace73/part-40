In a drunken stupor at a bar, she meets Miles who turns out to be her sparing equal, until she vomits all over his shoes. Just when she thinks things couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get worse, her dream man turns out to be the single father of the newest student in her class. \n\nWhile fighting an attraction for Miles, MoxieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conniving stepmother tries to advise Moxie she needs to get in shape if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever going to catch the man of her dreams. To make matters worse a Girl Scout plans MoxieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demise, a surprise party makes everyone blush, and then there was the skunkÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\nCan Moxie overcome all the Girl Scout cookies, food poisoning and a showdown at Costco to get to Miles?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba4ccbfec61f2b0805f05d4d3826feddca716030","amp;dn":"The+Chronicles+of+Moxie+by+Z.B.+Heller+%5Bepub%2Cmobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba4ccbfec61f2b0805f05d4d3826feddca716030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,76,203,254,198,31,43,8,5,240,93,77,56,38,254,221,202,113,96,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
