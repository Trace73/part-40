Tracks 3 and 4 were tagged the wrong\nway round.\n\nFew contemporary Brit rockers have been more widely ridiculed,\nor even loathed, than Johnny Borrell. It says a lot about the\ntimid, softly-softly approach of the current crop of musicians\nthat JB should be so reviled.\n\nOn the face of it, Johnny&amp;#039;s crimes match the standard-issue\ncharge sheet of the young upstart - modest talent struggling\nto inhabit an ego the size of Wembley Stadium, supreme\narrogance fuelling a mouth as big as the Mersey Tunnel. And on\nthe third Razorlight album - a record once thought to be in\njeopardy because even Johnny&amp;#039;s bandmates found him overbearing\n- he plays to the gallery.\n\nNorth London Trash is guttersnipe biography in the style of\nBorrell&amp;#039;s heroes The Clash, and offers a cheeky but honest pen\nportrait - &amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m really no one special/But I&amp;#039;ve seen you do\nmuch worse.&amp;#039;\n\nOn folksy ballad Hostage Of Love, he&amp;#039;s the ultimate martyr for\nthe cause - &amp;#039;Words of derision I have swallowed with a\nsmile/For telling my story I&amp;#039;ve been crucified&amp;#039;.\n\nBorrell&amp;#039;s Christ complex may, of course, mask a small\nwhimpering soul hounded by self doubt. But it&amp;#039;s the part he&amp;#039;s\nchosen to play. And he plays it well.\n\nSurely it&amp;#039;s good to have ambition, something to aspire to? But\nthat means aiming higher than the shooting fish in a barrel\nfunk gunk of Tabloid Lover. Which, to his credit, he does for\nthe most part, snaring the angry modern poet mantle on Blood\nFor Wild Blood, before launching into Burberry Blue Eyes - a\nseductively vicious attack on an aristocratic airhead shagging\nindiscriminately while slumming it on the King&amp;#039;s Road.\n\nIn time-honoured Dylanesque fashion, Borrell matches\nsensitivity to the savagery. You And The Rest ruefully\ncontemplates the challenges of monogamy (&amp;#039;There are only two\nwomen here/You and the rest that pass me by&amp;#039;), while the\nsilken, reflective 60 Thompson, savours the attractions of\ntogetherness.\n\nThroughout, Razorlight&amp;#039;s rock literacy is at least GCSE\nAdvanced Level and Johnny boy&amp;#039;s ability to rustle up a persona\nthat winds folk up seals the deal. Someone might want to break\nit, gently, to Chris Martin and co that when it comes to\nmaking rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; roll, niceness and modesty really aren&amp;#039;t that\nimportant.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd5dfc2267843e36484d9bcac1103f2ed6d202ca","amp;dn":"Razorlight-Slipway_Fires-%28Proper%29-2008-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd5dfc2267843e36484d9bcac1103f2ed6d202ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,93,252,34,103,132,62,54,72,77,155,202,193,16,63,46,214,210,2,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
