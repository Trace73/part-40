Kissin' U\n2. BAM\n3. Disgusting\n4. Shakespeare\n5. Hey You\n6. There Will Be Tears\n7. Oh Oh\n8. Daydream\n9. Brand New You\n10. What Are You Waiting For\n11. Beautiful Mess\n12. Adored\n13. Charlie\n\nRemember, this is a FLAC version of the album, so you'll need the right software to play it - VLC player does the job fine for me. There are two MP3 versions of this album available on TPB, but I didn't find the sound quality quite satisfactory when I tried them myself - probably since she sings so many high notes which would be more likely to be lost in the compression.\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41a76324b03c82ae8ce68e0e62bbcee5216e17e0","amp;dn":"Miranda+Cosgrove+-+Sparks+Fly+%28Deluxe+Version%29+%5B%5BFLAC%5D%5D+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41a76324b03c82ae8ce68e0e62bbcee5216e17e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,167,99,36,176,60,130,174,140,230,142,14,98,187,206,229,33,110,23,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
