Still under development but available to anyone who wishes to join.\n\nJoin Now! We are adding factions in a future update, and the leaders of the factions are planned to be the most influential players when the update is applied. Make it to that status before someone else does!\n\nThe music currently takes up most of the download. If you want to make it dramatically smaller, do not install the music files. You must go into options and turn off music in game though, or else you may hear annoying sounds instead of music.\n\nCurrently known Bugs:\nLegends doesn't like to work with Directx 10, and Vista users have been getting Run Time Error 339 even after registering the required ocx files. There might be a way around this but I haven't discovered it yet. I haven't tested other versions of windows, but my guess is that any OS with Directx 9 works. I am almost certain that Legends only works with Windows OS.\n\nPost any other bugs in the comments or e-mail them to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;176f74657e64646f74657864646f57707a767e7b3974787a&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; and I can help you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1a6d19c4ad373b97d9623087b3cd3a08a7eefc3","amp;dn":"Legends%3A+The+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1a6d19c4ad373b97d9623087b3cd3a08a7eefc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,166,209,156,74,211,115,185,125,150,35,8,123,60,211,160,138,126,239,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
