The Wehrmacht has begun Operation Hawk in an attempt to capture Kharkov with its steel claws. The SS Division Totenkopf has moved forward to crush the Soviet tank forces, but the Red Army has held the line, digging in and putting up a fierce resistance. In response, German tank armies have renewed their offensive with Operation Panther, and Soviet tank crews are now finding themselves severely outnumbered.\r\nWant to step into the role of a commander in the very heart of Kharkovâ€™s defense? You'll have everything the officers had back then: tanks, guns, and fearless soldiers. The success of each opposing force hangs in the balance every day. Your decisions will determine who wins the Battle of Kharkov.\r\nHigh replayability and flexible AI: â€œsmartâ€ AI analyzes the playersâ€™ tactical movements and chooses the best strategy based on behavior rather than a script. Scenarios can be replayed using different tactics, as though playing against a human opponent\r\nPainstaking reconstruction of Kharkov in scope and size\r\nDetailed recreation of weapons, artillery, and vehicles: all battle characteristics, including missile trajectories and crew numbers, have been modelled according to archived military records and WW2 chronicles\r\nDynamic day, night and weather effects, all of which affect combat through terrain traversability, battlefield visibility, hidden force capabilities, and more\r\nDestructible environment: nearly everything can be blasted and destroyed, from ground terrain to houses and enemy defenses. All traces of previous battles (shell holes, broken vehicles, corpses, etc.) remain on the battlefield\r\nRealistic ballistics: bullets and projectiles follow accurate trajectories. Proper shot longitude, number of frags, and their range are calculated\r\nComprehensive vehicle damage system: engine, suspension, weapons, and aiming mechanisms can all be damaged separately, affecting the combat capabilities of the vehicle\r\nReal soldier behavior: every soldier has several basic parameters, such as experience level, fatigue, and morale, which affect their behavior and effectiveness\r\nMilitary encyclopedia with 3D model viewer and detailed data on all units, describing their historical and in-game characteristics\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows Ð¥Ð  / Vista / 7 / 8 /10\r\nIntel Pentium D 3GHz, AMD Athlon x2 4200+ or better\r\n1 GB RAM\r\n2.6 GB hard disk space\r\nNvidia GeForce 7600 256 MB video card, ATI Radeon x1600 256 MB or better\r\nDirectXÂ®: 9.0c\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec2bec690b6b7978741eaa669900bf82e2d8f934","amp;dn":"Achtung+Panzer%3A+Kharkov+1943+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec2bec690b6b7978741eaa669900bf82e2d8f934","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,43,236,105,11,107,121,120,116,30,170,102,153,0,191,130,226,216,249,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
