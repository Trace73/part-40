Every human being, however, has disappeared. With the help of a slowly reviving computer network, the astronaut begins to piece together the events of the last century. He learns of the child prodigy Peter Devore, of a world orchestrated by stunning new technologies, and of Peter's race against time to unlock the secrets of the Portal.\n\nIf you're interested in interactive novels, try to track down the original 1986 computer game of the story, it's great.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03f921c3b5c2c28200e78ac904fcfccc206ab1e8","amp;dn":"Portal%3A+A+Dataspace+Retrieval+by+Rob+Swigart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03f921c3b5c2c28200e78ac904fcfccc206ab1e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,249,33,195,181,194,194,130,0,231,138,201,4,252,252,204,32,106,177,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
