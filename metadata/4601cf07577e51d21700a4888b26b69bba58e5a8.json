Our wheelchair-bound narrator Augustus Hill (Harold Perrineau Jr.) takes us through the wacky world of Emerald City, the experimental unit started by Tim McManus (Terry Kinney). There's shankin' and lovin' and cussin' and fightin' but in the end, HBO makes a damn fine prison drama. It's gritty. And there you have it.\n\nAll 6 seasons, all ripped from PAL DVD by myself, all encoded in XviD and all in one place for you to download and enjoy.\n\nPlease have patience; this mutha's huge and my upload speed isn't 'all that'... Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4601cf07577e51d21700a4888b26b69bba58e5a8","amp;dn":"Oz+%5Bcomplete+series%2C+all+seasons%2C+DVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4601cf07577e51d21700a4888b26b69bba58e5a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,1,207,7,87,126,81,210,23,0,164,136,139,38,182,155,186,88,229,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
