They developed a ProvenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§al hybrid version of reggae, rub-a-dub and raggamuffin with lyrics in the French and Occitan languages, sometimes referred to as trobamuffin (from the Occitan word trobador and the musical style raggamuffin), though they have also performed in Portuguese and Italian. They incorporate many rhythms, beats and samples from the local tradition or other musical colleagues, and their lyrics indicate a profound parochialism for Marseille and the south of France in general.\n\nMassilia Sound System re-popularised the city of Marseille in the 1990s, in conjunction with the success of Olympique de Marseille, the local soccer club. Along with that empowered an entire generation of young Marseillais with a positive identity, proud of their city and their capacity to embrace different cultural traditions.\n\nAlbums:\n# Parla Patois (1992)\n# Chourmo (1993)\n# Commando Fada (1995)\n# On met le ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â²ai partout (live, non rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ditÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©), 1996)\n# AÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ollywood (1997)\n# Marseille London Experience (remixs avec Mad Professor and The Robotiks, 1999)\n# 3968 CR 13 (2000)\n# Occitanista (2002)\n# Massilia fait tourner (live, 2004)\n# Oai e libertat (2007)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed45fd019961cb3a8ce8472cd5523f8c79b649e3","amp;dn":"Massilia+sound+system+-+10+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed45fd019961cb3a8ce8472cd5523f8c79b649e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,69,253,1,153,97,203,58,140,232,71,44,213,82,63,140,121,182,73,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
