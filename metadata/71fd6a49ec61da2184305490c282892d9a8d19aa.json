Primarily known for the classic &quot;Oi&amp;#039;ve Got A Brand New Combine Harvester (I&amp;#039;ll Give You The Key)&quot;, this Best Of compilation has so much more to offer than bizarre West Country ways of proposing marriage. For starters it contains the utter classic &quot;I Am A Cider Drinker&quot;, a drinking song to the tune of &quot;Una Paloma Blanca&quot;, complete with hearty &quot;Oooo-arrr&quot; chorus. Like Ivor Biggun, this is British smutty humour at its best, with songs like the tale of the &quot;Market Gardener&quot;, who takes his date to the garden to show her his &quot;produce&quot; only to hear her utter the magical words, &quot;I&amp;#039;d like to take a sample of your cucumber home tonight&quot;, or the slightly dodgier &quot;In The Back Of My Old Car&quot; with it&amp;#039;s scary refrain of &quot;I&amp;#039;ll give you an economy ride&quot;. Ooo-arrrr, missus. --\n\nHelen Marquis\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71fd6a49ec61da2184305490c282892d9a8d19aa","amp;dn":"The+Finest+%5C%27Arvist+of+The+Wurzels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71fd6a49ec61da2184305490c282892d9a8d19aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,253,106,73,236,97,218,33,132,48,84,144,194,130,137,45,154,141,25,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
