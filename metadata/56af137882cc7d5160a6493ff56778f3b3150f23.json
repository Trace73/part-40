Now, she and her three best friends are in desperate need of a weekend getaway and decide it's the perfect time for a fling in Monte Carlo.\n\nThey surrender themselves to every temptation: fine dining, high-stakes gambling, and gorgeous men. But the fun comes to a screeching halt when two bodies are found, and they become the police's prime suspects.\n\nIn a dramatic trial, the women's lives are laid bare. It becomes clear that they have been framed, but one question remains: Who is trying to lock them away forever? With delicious twists and death-defying speed, GUILTY WIVES is a nonstop joy-ride of excess, friendship, and betrayal as only James Patterson can create.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56af137882cc7d5160a6493ff56778f3b3150f23","amp;dn":"Guilty+Wives+by+James+Patterson+%28.MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56af137882cc7d5160a6493ff56778f3b3150f23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,175,19,120,130,204,125,81,96,166,73,63,245,103,120,243,179,21,15,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
