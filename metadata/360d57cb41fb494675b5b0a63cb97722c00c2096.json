The 64-page graphic novel is about crime, lust and redemption as it follows two distinct, yet similarly-themed stories written by Palmiotti and Justin Gray, and illustrated by Jimmy Broxton and Juan SantaCruz. As the title of the book suggests, it is intended for an adult audience.\n\n\nIf you like it, buy it. I'm a pirate too but I support good books where I can. I understand some of you can't afford it and this is the only way you're ever going to read it. I'm poor too but while scamming Marvel and DC isn't too bad because they're giants, these little indie books need all the help they can get. So if you can afford it, buy it.
