In keeping with the tragic element of the group's best-known singles -- including &quot;Helena,&quot; &quot;I'm Not OK (I Promise),&quot; and &quot;Welcome to the Black Parade&quot; -- My Chemical Romance has roots in catastrophe, as frontman Gerard Way decided to form the band after watching the World Trade Center collapse on September 11, 2001. Drummer Matt Pelissier joined one week later, guitarist Ray Toro climbed aboard soon after, and the quintet's ranks solidified with the addition of bassist Mikey Way (Gerard's younger brother) and guitarist Frank Iero. With their lineup in place, the bandmates began touring and making plans for an album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81ef649d3243bb5c1bea770087da520f5e2de87","amp;dn":"My+Chemical+Romance+-+May+Death+Never+Stop+You+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81ef649d3243bb5c1bea770087da520f5e2de87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,30,246,73,211,36,59,181,193,190,167,112,8,125,165,32,245,226,222,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
