The album was recorded between March and September 1981 and first released in the UK on 16 October 1981, then subsequently in the U.S. in mid-1982.\n\nThe style of the album is the result of the rapid evolution of The Human League from experimental avant-garde electronic group into a commercial pop group under Philip Oakey's creative direction following the departure of fellow founding members Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh. Dare became critically acclaimed and has proved to be a genre-defining album, whose influence can be felt in many areas of pop music today. The album and its four singles were hugely successful commercially, with the album reaching #1 in the UK and being certified Triple Platinum by the BPI.\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1. The Things That Dreams Are Made Of\n2. Open Your Heart\n3. The Sound of the Crowd\n4. Darkness\n5. Do or Die\n6. Get Carter\n7. I Am the Law\n8. Seconds\n9. Love Action (I Believe in Love)\n10.
