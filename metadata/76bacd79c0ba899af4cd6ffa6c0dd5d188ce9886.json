Ageless and immortal, its citizens lived in peaceful splendor. But as Sol buckled under the swell of an immorbid population, space itself literally ran outâ€¦.\r\n\r\nConrad Mursk has returned to Sol on the crippled starship Newhope. His crew are the frozen refugees of a failed colony known as Barnardâ€™s Star. A thousand years older, Mursk finds Sol on the brink of rebellion, while a fanatic necro cult is reviving death itself. Now Mursk and his lover, Captain Xiomara â€œXmaryâ€ Li Weng, are sent on a final, desperate mission by King Bruno de Towajiâ€“one of the greatest terraformers of the agesâ€“to literally crush the moon. If they succeed, theyâ€™ll save\r\nbillions of lost souls. If they fail, theyâ€™ll strand humanity between deathâ€“and something unimaginably worseâ€¦. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 96 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76bacd79c0ba899af4cd6ffa6c0dd5d188ce9886","amp;dn":"Wil+McCarthy+-+To+Crush+the+Moon+%28The+Queendom+of+Sol+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76bacd79c0ba899af4cd6ffa6c0dd5d188ce9886","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,186,205,121,192,186,137,154,244,205,111,250,108,13,213,209,136,206,152,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
