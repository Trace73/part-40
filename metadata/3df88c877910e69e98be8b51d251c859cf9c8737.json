He has collaborated with many important musicians, including\nThe Rolling Stones, Van Morrison, Neil Young &amp; Crazy Horse, Earl Hines, Little Feat,\nCaptain Beefheart, The Chieftains, John Lee Hooker, Pops, Mavis Staples, Gabby Pahinui,\nFlaco Jimenez, Ibrahim Ferrer [Buena Vista Social Club], Freddy Fender and Ali Farka\nToure. He formed the Little Village supergroup with Nick Lowe, John Hiatt, and Jim Keltner.\n\nCooder was ranked 8th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of\nAll Time.&quot; A 2010 ranking by Gibson placed him at @32.\n\n\n1970s\n\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of Warner Bros. Records albums that\nshowcased his guitar work. Cooder, like a musicologist or treasure hunter, explored bygone\nmusical genres and found great old~time recordings which he then, as a musician,\npersonalized with sensitive, updated reworkings. Thus, on his breakthrough album, Into the\nPurple Valley, he chose unusual instrumentations and performed his own arrangements of\nold Black blues and gospel songs, a Calypso, white country music songs [giving a tempo\nchange to the cowboy ballad, &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;], and ~ to open the album ~ a protest song,\n&quot;How Can You Keep on Moving [Unless You Migrate Too]&quot; by Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham\nabout the Okies who were not welcomed with open arms when they migrated to escape the\nDust Bowl in the 1930s ~ to which he gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment.\nCooder's later '70s albums [with the exception of Jazz] do not fall under a single genre\ndescription, but ~ to generalize broadly ~ it might be fair to call Cooder's self titled first album\nblues; Into the Purple Valley, Boomer's Story, and Paradise and Lunch, folk and blues;\nChicken Skin Music and Showtime, a unique melange of Tex-Mex and Hawaiian; Jazz,\n1920s jazz; Bop Till You Drop, '50's R&amp;B; and Borderline and Get Rhythm, eclectic\nrock~based excursions.Cooder's 1979 album Bop Till You Drop was the first popular music\nalbum to be recorded digitally. It yielded his biggest hit, an R&amp;B cover version of Elvis\nPresley's 1960s recording &quot;Little Sister&quot;. Ry Cooder is credited on Van Morrison's 1979\nalbum, Into the Music, for slide guitar on the song &quot;Full Force Gale&quot;.\n\n\n\n  01. &quot;How Can You Keep Moving[Unless You Migrate Too][Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham] ~ 2:25\n  02. &quot;Billy the Kid&quot; [Traditional] ~ 3:45\n  03. &quot;Money Honey&quot; [Jesse Stone] ~ 3:28\n  04. &quot;FDR in Trinidad&quot; [Fitz Maclean] ~ 3:01\n  05. &quot;Teardrops Will Fall&quot; [Dickey Doo, Marion Smith] ~ 3:03\n  06. &quot;Denomination Blues&quot; [George Washington Phillips] ~ 3:58\n  07. &quot;On a Monday&quot; [Leadbelly] ~ 2:52\n  08. &quot;Hey Porter&quot; [Johnny Cash] ~~ 4:34\n  09. &quot;Great Dream from Heaven&quot; [Joseph Spence] ~ 1:53\n  10. &quot;Taxes on the Farmer Feeds Us All&quot; [Traditional] ~ 3:52\n  11. &quot;Vigilante Man&quot; [Woody Guthrie] ~ 4:15\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:37:46\nTotal Size...........: 193.09 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Ry-Cooder-Into-The-Purple-Valley/release/1103763&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Ry-Cooder-Into-The-Purple-Valley/release/1103763&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df88c877910e69e98be8b51d251c859cf9c8737","amp;dn":"Ry+Cooder+-+Into+The+Purple+Valley+1972+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df88c877910e69e98be8b51d251c859cf9c8737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,248,140,135,121,16,230,158,152,190,139,81,210,81,200,89,207,156,135,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
