Showcasing 10 concise, country-rooted gems that sound equally good whether you're hanging on the front porch in the afternoon or nursing a bottle after hours, this one could win over many an anti-Jerry. \nBewildered by loss both personal and social--the hippie dream was quickly crashing by Beauty's 1970 release date--the band put its querulousness &quot;Box of Rain&quot; and wry humor &quot;Truckin'&quot; into the service of a masterwork. The most impressive cut of all may be &quot;Ripple,&quot; Garcia's spiritual credo.  --Rickey Wright\n\nBio:\n\n\nRock's longest, strangest trip, the Grateful Dead were the psychedelic era's most beloved musical ambassadors as well as its most enduring survivors, spreading their message of peace, love, and mind-expansion across the globe throughout the better part of three decades. The object of adoration for popular music's most fervent and celebrated fan following -- the Deadheads, their numbers and devotion legendary in their own right -- they were the ultimate cult band, creating a self-styled universe all their own; for the better part of their career orbiting well outside of the mainstream, the Dead became superstars solely on their own terms, tie-dyed pied pipers whose epic, free-form live shows were rites of passage for an extended family of listeners who knew no cultural boundaries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abec273649369249f38222dcdaff5058ebb5dd49","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+American+Beauty+-+1970+%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abec273649369249f38222dcdaff5058ebb5dd49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,236,39,54,73,54,146,73,243,130,34,220,218,255,80,88,235,181,221,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
