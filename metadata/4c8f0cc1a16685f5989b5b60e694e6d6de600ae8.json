She also canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deny she loves to kiss him-his mouth might be his most precious asset. Despite every promise to herself not to get involved any deeper than a first date, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep from seeing more of Aiden . . . in more ways than one.\n\nAiden Downey had no idea the hot blonde from the club would trigger his protective, gentle nature, but the moment she drops her guard and he sees the real Sadie Howard, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a goner. When a family crisis puts the brakes on their budding romance, can Aiden find a way to hold on to her? Or will he lose the best thing in his life just as quickly as he found her?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8f0cc1a16685f5989b5b60e694e6d6de600ae8","amp;dn":"Can%27t+Let+Go+%28Love+in+the+Balance%29+-+Lemmon%2C+Jessica.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8f0cc1a16685f5989b5b60e694e6d6de600ae8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,143,12,193,161,102,133,245,152,155,91,96,230,148,230,214,222,96,10,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
