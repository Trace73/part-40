The rip was created by an unknown user, and it is currently only available via magnet on T0rr!ndex. It's an excellent rip created with cdparanoia and FLAC 1.2.1; I hope TPB appreciates it and gives it new life. Kudos to the original creator, whoever he/she is.\n\nTureck's recordings are terrific, and rightfully considered something of a counterpart to Gould's versions. Highly recommended.\n\nPlease seed at least 1:1, if possible. --chabosun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9d693148adea6d87f211545babea0de2e3831d","amp;dn":"J.S.+Bach+-+The+Well-Tempered+Clavier+%28Tureck%29+%5BFLAC%5D%5BRESEED%5D%5Bch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9d693148adea6d87f211545babea0de2e3831d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,157,105,49,72,173,234,109,135,242,17,84,91,171,234,13,226,227,131,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
