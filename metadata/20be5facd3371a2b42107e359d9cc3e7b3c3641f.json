This includes some of the terminology, an explanation of various products\nand projects, as well as some design basics. From there, we look at specific\nprojects.

This provides not only security functions, but also ties in various X10\ndevices that can react when an alarm is tripped. While this device is not necessary\nto complete most of the projects in this book, it does provide an\nunderstanding for intermediate and advanced Smart Home projects that would\nutilize a security system or a home automation system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20be5facd3371a2b42107e359d9cc3e7b3c3641f","amp;dn":"Build+Your+Own+Smart+Home","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20be5facd3371a2b42107e359d9cc3e7b3c3641f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,190,95,172,211,55,26,43,66,16,126,53,157,156,195,231,179,195,100,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
