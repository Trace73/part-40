The Sabbath-meets-Funkadelic of &quot;Fresh Vines&quot; comes from 1991&amp;#039;s Face, the 90-second hardcore blast of &quot;Cop Kisser&quot; is taken from Mack Avenue Skullgame, and &quot;Lot Lizard&quot; would become more widely available on 1994&amp;#039;s Platinum Jive &quot;compilation&quot; (though the liner notes to that record would trace its origin to 1984&amp;#039;s Power Hour -- wink wink). Since &quot;Wasted on B.C. (Fresh Flavor Remix)&quot; was included on the U.S. edition of Face, the completist is only getting two new tracks, both of which are remixes of &quot;Fresh Vines.&quot; The intense &quot;Dirty Double Bottom (Meat Rack Remix)&quot; adds a hip-hop beat and industrial grind to the guitars, without sounding like Ministry. Barry Henssler&amp;#039;s vocals are more intense here than on the original. Henssler dedicates &quot;Midnight Vines (Cool Jazz for Lovers)&quot; to the ladies; the tempo fittingly slinks along as the vocals are given the late-night treatment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f8813eb399ae3f7c3eed16f55f0c135ed154847","amp;dn":"Big+Chief+-+Brand+Product+%281993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f8813eb399ae3f7c3eed16f55f0c135ed154847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,136,19,235,57,154,227,247,195,238,209,111,85,240,193,53,237,21,72,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
