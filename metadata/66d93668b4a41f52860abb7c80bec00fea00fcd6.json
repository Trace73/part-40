On the A side we have the no-holds-barred dance floor destroyer Killer Bees, a blueprint of what you can expect from D&amp;F in the coming months after their year long Glitch Hop hiatus, and on the flip we have Vibes, a tribute to the sound of 2010 and a nod to some of their favourite dubstep pioneers at the time. With USA and Australian tours lined up before the year comes to a close, there couldn't be more perfect timing for Dodge &amp; Fuski to return to the genre that got them to where they were in the first place. Keep it locked for much more like this coming your way soon...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/500x500/10429960.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://geo-media.beatport.com/image_size/500x500/10429960.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d93668b4a41f52860abb7c80bec00fea00fcd6","amp;dn":"Dodge+%26amp%3B+Fuski+-+Killer+Bees+%5BDISC020%5D%5BDUBSTEP%5D%5BZeRo+%7C+320kps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d93668b4a41f52860abb7c80bec00fea00fcd6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,217,54,104,180,164,31,82,134,10,187,124,128,190,192,15,234,0,252,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
