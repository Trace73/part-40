Artists as varied as the Moody Blues, Soft Cell\r\nMariah Carey and UB40 with their 'retake' on someone else's song - ultimate chart hits\r\nthat are, in some cases, perhaps even better than the original.\r\n\r\nArguably the Beatles, alongside Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys, introduced the notion of\r\n'originality' and self-generating artists writing their songs into the pop lexicon in the\r\n60s. One of the most fascinating consequences of this has been the 'original' cover version\r\na reinterpretation of someone else's song that has transformed it into pop gold with a shift\r\nof rhythm, intent and context. The pop cover has proved a remarkably imaginative and durable\r\nform and this compilation tracks this pop alchemy at its finest and most intriguing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/92930263980440613576.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/58182711856183356439.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/64487826167266390364.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 616 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1200 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 58mn 49s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9897eab4bb0bb447b40c43dcd335d55302a575f","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Ultimate+Cover+Versions+at+the+BBC+2015+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9897eab4bb0bb447b40c43dcd335d55302a575f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,137,126,171,75,176,187,68,123,64,196,61,205,51,93,85,48,42,87,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
