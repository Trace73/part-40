Could it possibly be an inside job? Nothing less than the honour of St Austin's is at stake, not to mention the reputation of Jim Thomson, an excellent athlete with a talent for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. In this charming novel of school life, the first book he published, Wodehouse demonstrates right away a talent for story telling and characterisation, not to mention a sharp ear for the inflections of schoolboy speech, still recognisable after more than a century. But what marks the story out from others of the same sort are the many humorous touches which hint at a master of comedy in the making.\n\nExcerpt\n'Where have I seen that face before?' said a voice. Tony Graham looked up from his bag. 'Hullo, Allen,' he said, 'what the dickens are you up here for?' 'I was rather thinking of doing a little boxing. If you've no objection, of course.'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a350e885f6554d5792939ad7aa2a0030d35643","amp;dn":"The+Pothunters+by+P+G+Wodehouse+%5BePub%5D+-+Traitor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a350e885f6554d5792939ad7aa2a0030d35643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,163,80,232,133,246,85,77,87,146,147,154,215,170,42,0,48,211,86,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
