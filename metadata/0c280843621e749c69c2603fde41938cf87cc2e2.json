There has also been a wealth of research on the properties of natural rubber and how they can be best used, for example, incorporating fillers or developing natural rubber composite materials. This important book summarizes this research and its significance for the industrial applications of natural rubber, with chapters on its properties, applications, and environmental and safety issues, such as recycling and allergies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c280843621e749c69c2603fde41938cf87cc2e2","amp;dn":"Chemistry%2C+Manufacture+and+Applications+of+Natural+Rubber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c280843621e749c69c2603fde41938cf87cc2e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,40,8,67,98,30,116,156,105,194,96,63,222,65,147,140,248,124,194,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
