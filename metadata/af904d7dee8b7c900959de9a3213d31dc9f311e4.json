Influenced by what Mann calls the &quot;super pop&quot; of the 70s and 80s, the album is her first release since 2008Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrated @#%&amp;*! Smilers, which the BBC called &quot;undeniably beautiful.&quot; Of Charmer, her eighth studio album, Mann comments, &quot;I'm fascinated by charming people and the whole idea of charm. It's hard to remember sometimes that there is usually an agenda behind the act of being charming, and that is what I'm most interested in. Is someone's charm being utilized just to try and entertain people, make them feel special and interesting, or is there a more sinister purpose behind it? Sometimes I think 'charm' can just be another word for 'manipulation.'&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af904d7dee8b7c900959de9a3213d31dc9f311e4","amp;dn":"Aimee+Mann+-+Charmer+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af904d7dee8b7c900959de9a3213d31dc9f311e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,144,77,125,238,139,124,144,9,89,222,154,50,19,211,29,201,243,17,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
