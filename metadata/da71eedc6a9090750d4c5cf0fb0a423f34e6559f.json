The three got together regularly in Mark's livingroom to work up arrangements of classic blues and original songs for two slide guitars and voices. Soon, joined by a rotating cast of percussionists, drummers, and bassists, the band was playing in rib joints, nightclubs, and festivals around Atlanta and neighboring cities. Following the March 2002 release of their debut CD, imaginatively entitled &quot;Delta Moon,&quot; the band started ranging farther from home, taking their energetic stage show across the US, Canada and Europe. As one audience member said, &quot;Thanks for inviting us to your party!&quot;\n&quot;Live&quot; was recorded February 21, 2003, before a live audience in The Cave, Tree Sound Studios, Duluth, Georgia.\nDelta Moon's line-up at the time of this recording was Tom Gray on vocals, lap steel guitar, and keyboards, Mark Johnson on bottleneck guitar, Gina Leigh on vocals and hand percussion, Johnny McKnight on drums, and Jon Schwenke on bass.
