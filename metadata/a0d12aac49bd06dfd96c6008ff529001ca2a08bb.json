A synthesist of remarkable savvy, Kidjo brings together radio-friendly pop, soul-diva stylings, and contemporary club production with vocal motifs and rhythms fromher native Benin. AYE is a further step in the artist&amp;#039;s efforts to blend these disparate elements.\nRecorded half at Minneapolis&amp;#039;s Paisley Park studios (with sessions produced by Prince collaborator David Z), they reflect the punchy guitar and synth-dominated Minneapolis sound. And half in London at Soul II Soul studios (with sessions produced by Soul II Soul&amp;#039;s Will Mowat), with both a dance-soul flavor and nice horn backing and arrangements AYE&amp;#039;s reflects the eclectic yet streamlined pop aesthetics of those respective camps. The album&amp;#039;s single, &quot;Agolo&quot;, leads off, and establishes the bright Afropop sound that dominates the rest of the disc. The harder-edged &quot;Adouma&quot; and the expansive, soaring &quot;Djan-Djan&quot; help mix things up, making AYE an adventurous listening experience.\n\n\n\n01.
