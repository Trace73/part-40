It includes the entire ARG collected up into printable book form with a data disc of audio and video associated with the game.\n\nThere are also a number of other goodies like the Year Zero Foundry Gridnik font, an interview with Trent Reznor about the creation of YZ, the original unedited 39 minute version of the OSR meeting on 18-04-2007 at the conclusion of the game, etc.\n\nThe YZ ARG was one of the best online experiences I ever had, and I feel honored to have participated in something so historic.\n\nFull disclosure: I am Wanted Resistance Network Member 24.24.2.2995, according to the US Bureau of Morality (as documented in Exhibit 24)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4190049144e286192015abc4309b4a6c53cbfd28","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+-+Year+Zero+ARG+media","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4190049144e286192015abc4309b4a6c53cbfd28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,144,4,145,68,226,134,25,32,21,171,196,48,155,74,108,83,203,253,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
