Kindred spirits to acts such as the Raveonettes\nand Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the group has a more\nstraightforward sound than those artists, allowing the\nemotive, heavily accented singing of James Allan to shine\nthrough. In late 2007, the Glaswegian band gained significant\nattention, particularly in the U.K., thanks in large part to\nardent supporter Alan McGee, former head of Creation Records.\nThis buzz led to the ensemble signing with the Columbia label,\nand unveiling its self-titled album to considerable accolades.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add84ecf41ea261f5c1ff0409f45dc1eb77746cf","amp;dn":"Glasvegas-Flowers_And_Football_Tops-%28Promo_CDM%29-2009-DV8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add84ecf41ea261f5c1ff0409f45dc1eb77746cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,216,78,207,65,234,38,31,92,31,240,64,159,69,220,30,183,119,70,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
