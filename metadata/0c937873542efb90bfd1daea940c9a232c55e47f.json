I was a teenager in Buffalo, NY in the late 90s and loved The Tea Party. I even got to see them live a few times. In the late 90s and early 00's there was a ftp site that hosted many of these, but has long since gone down. Due to the unavailability of many of these shows, I have decided to make them available once again. This is my first torrent ever. Please seed to keep this going.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n1992-04-04 Coach and Horses,Windsor\n1994-01-09 Live at Australian Radio Station Triple J\n1994-06-12 The Spectrum Montreal\n1995-09-13 Midnite Rodeo Waco, TX\n1996-03-25 live in Australia\n1997-08-08 Live at Australian Radio Station Triple J\n1996-11-07 Lee's Palace,Toronto\n1997-11-08 Ottawa\n1998-00-00 MuchMusic\n1999-08-25 Willem II Concert Hall, Den Bosch, Holland\n1999-09-21 Kitchener, Ontario\n1999-10-00 Sydney (Live downunderground)\n1999-11-22 Massey Hall,Toronto\n1999-11-23 Massey Hall,Toronto\n1999-11-27 Montreal  (Metropolis - This is the concert's complete version\n1999-11-29 Quebec\n2000-00-00 Edgefest2000\n2000-01-09 Live @ The Dardanella [Wasaga Beach, Ontario] poor quality\n2000-02-09 Amsterdam\n2000-02-10 Rotterdam Nighttown\n2000-02-25 Daytona, Sandjob2000\n2000-04-00 Live @ Musique Plus April 2000\n2000-06-20 The Paradiso, Amsterdam\n2000-06-23 Dresden\n2000-06-30 Montreal\n2000-07-21 Jack Singer Hall\n2000-09-09 London,ON Western Fair Grounds\n2000-12-15 Toronto\n2000-12-31 Buffalo\n2001-07-26 Sarnia Ribfest\n2001-08-18 Live at the Kee to Bala\n2001-12-14 Amsterdam Melkweg\n2001-12-16 Zwolle\n2002-04-09 Edmonton\n2002-10-08  Perth WA\n2002-11-08 The Tea Party - Tea and Symphony at Massey Hall in Toronto\n2002-12-2  Live at Hordon Pavillion, Sydney, AUS\n2003-09-07 Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver\n2004-09-25 Bourbon Street in St. Adele, Quebec\n2005-05-05 The Modclub, Toronto\n2005-07-09 Live with 103.3 the Edge in Buffalo, NY\nIndie- rare first album\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c937873542efb90bfd1daea940c9a232c55e47f","amp;dn":"The+Tea+Party-+41+Live+Shows+and+Indie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c937873542efb90bfd1daea940c9a232c55e47f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,147,120,115,84,46,251,144,191,209,218,234,148,12,154,35,44,85,228,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
