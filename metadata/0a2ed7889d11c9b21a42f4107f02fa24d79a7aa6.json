Return to Ostagar allows players to reclaim the secrets lost on that battlefield. The downloadable content will be available for the PC and 360 on January 5th, with the PlayStation 3 version arriving later in January.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a2ed7889d11c9b21a42f4107f02fa24d79a7aa6","amp;dn":"Dragon+Age+Origins++Ostagar+%5BEnglish%5D%5BDLC%5D%5Bgamerguuy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a2ed7889d11c9b21a42f4107f02fa24d79a7aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,46,215,136,157,17,201,178,26,66,244,16,127,2,250,36,215,154,122,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
