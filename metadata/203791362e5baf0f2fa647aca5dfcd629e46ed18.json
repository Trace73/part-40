Suite 8 gives you all of the features in Live 8 plus sound, with a radically new Library packed with beautiful new sounds and a wealth of useful resources. Suite 8 contains 11 Ableton instruments and effects including synths, a sampler, electric and acoustic drums, mallets, numerous sampled instruments, the new, reworked Operator and amp modeling effects. Two completely new instruments, Collision and Latin Percussion, round off the set. Ableton Suite 8 is a complete package: the tools and the sounds.\n\nThe tools\n\nAbleton Live 8 provides a comprehensive environment for writing, producing and performing music.\n\nSession View\n\nLive is the only music production software with the \\\\\\&quot;Session View\\\\\\&quot;: a unique grid for recording and playing musical ideas and phrases. The Session View is non-linear, so you can record and play back your ideas in any order you want. When you\\\\\\'re working on a new track, this is a smart, flexible way to write and record. If you\\\\\\'re performing music live, it gives you complete flexibility and freedom to improvise.\n\nArrangement View\n\nLive also has a second view: the \\\\\\&quot;Arrangement View,\\\\\\&quot; a complete music production environment. This is the linear counterpart to the Session View and is well-suited to \\\\\\&quot;traditional\\\\\\&quot; recording, arranging and mixing. These two views interact with one another, each with its own strengths and intricacies. Both views are based on the single principle of creative, intuitive music-making.\n\nUninterrupted creative flow\n\nIn Live, you never have to stop the music. Record audio and MIDI on the fly, drop in loops and samples, add effects and swap sounds without ever hitting the stop button: everything happens in real time. You\\\\\\'re free to improvise and the computer actually becomes a musical instrumentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an expressive and creative tool, perfectly at home on stage or in the studio.\n\nTotally compatible\n\nLive works seamlessly with controller hardware and assigning custom MIDI controls is simple. Live supports AIFF, WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis and FLAC files, VST and AU effects and instruments. Live can handle REX files and runs as a ReWire Master or Slave, so it works nicely alongside other DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic, Cubase or Reason. And if you have a multicore or multiprocessor system, Live supports that, too.\n\nBeats made easy\n\nLive\\\\\\'s unique Drum Rack combines drag-and-drop simplicity in a familiar pad-style interface. Each of the 128 drum pads can have its own instrument or sample plus effects. Slice beats, loops or REX files to MIDI for additional control options and use the new groove feature (which includes grooves from the legendary MPC and SP1200 machines) to add swing to your beats.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:203791362e5baf0f2fa647aca5dfcd629e46ed18","amp;dn":"Ableton+Live+v8.2.1+%5Bx86%5D%5Bx64%5D+Torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"203791362e5baf0f2fa647aca5dfcd629e46ed18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,55,145,54,46,91,175,15,47,166,71,172,165,223,205,98,158,70,237,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
