This release 16th August 2010 on Blue Note.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThe title of this Blue Note set, Doin' Allright, fit perfectly at the time, for tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon was making the first of three successful comebacks. Largely neglected during the 1950s, Gordon's Blue Note recordings (of which this was the first) led to his rediscovery. The tenor is teamed with the young trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, pianist Horace Parlan, bassist George Tucker, and drummer Al Harewood for a strong set of music that is highlighted by &quot;You've Changed&quot; (which would become a permanent part of Gordon's repertoire), &quot;Society Red&quot; (a blues later used in the film Round Midnight), and &quot;It's You or No One.&quot;\n\n01.
