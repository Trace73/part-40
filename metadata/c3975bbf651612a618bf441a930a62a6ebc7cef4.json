DVD rip, standard definition.  Constant-quality rip, hence the varying file size.  Quality indistinguishable from the source DVD (which isn't actually that spectacular.)  Can't find any HD source so have to upload SD.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia:\r\n\r\nBig, Bigger, Biggest is a British documentary television series which began airing in 2008. A total 20 episodes have been produced across 3 seasons.\r\n\r\nEach episode explores the engineering breakthroughs that have made it possible to develop the largest structures of today. Throughout the course of the episode, viewers are introduced to generally 4-7 landmark inventions that have enabled the engineers of today to construct the world's biggest structures. Footage of the construction of the world's biggest structure of its kind is accompanied by computer generated imagery which often has an element of black humour. This imagery shows the size of the object in meters, the various designs that may have been considered as well as what could happen if the engineers made a mistake, complete with animated figures running in panic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3975bbf651612a618bf441a930a62a6ebc7cef4","amp;dn":"Big%2C+Bigger%2C+Biggest+%28Series+1-3%2C+BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3975bbf651612a618bf441a930a62a6ebc7cef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,151,91,191,101,22,18,166,24,191,68,26,147,10,98,166,235,199,206,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
