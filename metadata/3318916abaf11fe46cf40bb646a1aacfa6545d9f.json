When a murder occurs and a bride (Chelan Simmons) is kidnapped surrounding the wedding of a prominent family embroiled in a high profile fraud scandal, Carnegie becomes a suspect. She is questioned by police and pursued by shady news reporter Aaron Gold (Andrew W. Walker). To make matters more terrifying, Carnegie is pretty certain whoever is responsible for the crime is out to get rid of her. As she struggles to clear her name, Carnegie is hounded by a hard-boiled detective (Rick Ravanello) and wooed by a handsome lawyer (Brandon Beemer). With her life exploding into a whirlwind mix of danger, mystery, and romance, Carnegie begins to realize that love does not always arrive in a pretty package and that the perfect &quot;Prince Charming&quot; she's been waiting for may not have her best interests in mind. \r\n\r\n\r\nFormat : MPEG-4\r\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\r\nCodec ID : mp42 (isom/iso2/avc1/mp41)\r\nFile size : 559 MiB\r\nDuration : 1h 23mn\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 935 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\r\nWidth : 864 pixels\r\nHeight : 480 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 29.970\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\nScan type : Progressive\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nTitle : Stereo\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3318916abaf11fe46cf40bb646a1aacfa6545d9f","amp;dn":"Wedding+Planner+Mystery+2014+Hallmark+480p+HDTV+X264+Solar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3318916abaf11fe46cf40bb646a1aacfa6545d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,24,145,106,186,241,31,228,108,244,11,182,70,161,170,207,166,84,93,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
