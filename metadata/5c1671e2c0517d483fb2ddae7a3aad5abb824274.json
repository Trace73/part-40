The Pins and Loverboy swapped drummers, and Frenette was gone and Bernie Aubin was in, who incidentally co-wrote Loverboy's &quot;The Kid Is Hot Tonite&quot;. \n\nBefore the end of the year however, it was decided that McCann wasn't right for the job of translating MacLeod's musical vision and was replaced by Darby Mills, already a seasoned session worker and singer of Streetback, a group closer to what MacLeod had in mind than McCann's disco background.\n\nThey continued playing the Vancouver area and won a local radio station's 'battle of the bands' competition in 1981. CFOX's album later that year featured two of their tracks, a live version of &quot;Breakin' Down&quot; and &quot;When A Man Loves a Woman&quot;, their only recorded cover. Even while still negotiatiating a record deal their impact was immediate. The band's live magnetism was rivalled by few and they soon became one of the hottest commodities on the West Coast, beginning with their first show in hometown Vancouver backing up Pat Travers and Blackmore's Rainbow.\n\nThey inked a deal with independant Solid Gold Records before year's end and went into Vancouver's Little Mountain Studios, coming out with TURN IT LOUD in the spring of 1982. Co-produced by Bill Henderson, Bryant and Macleod's Chilliwack-mate, the record allowed the Headpins to hit the scene with an experienced master behind the controls. Charged with emotions, Macleod's guitars rang predominant, almost a friendly battle with Mills' immediately signature voice. With Bryant and Aubin serving a tight powerful backbeat and beginning with the lead-off title-track, it grabbed you by the balls and refused to let go, finding its place in rock history as one of rock's greatest anthems of all time.\n\nMills' style became known as the growl and would go on to lead the charge in their energized live show, She was compared more to Robert Plant or David Coverdale than, say Ann Wilson or Janis Joplin. &quot;Don't It Make Ya Feel&quot; turned the FM stations upside down, as did the title track, backed by the killer &quot;Breakin' Down&quot;, one person's handling his problems via suicide, and &quot;People&quot;. Even the power ballad &quot;Winnin'&quot; packed a punch, but still showed Mills' range. By the time TURN IT LOUD turned platinum just a few short months later, the band had already toured most of the continent. The debut would go on to sell over a quarter-million copies in Canada alone and be certified double platinum, making it one of the most successful debut albums by a Canadian group ever. Macleod's and Bryant's prior commitments to Chilliwack allowed them to only tour part of the schedule, while Mills and Aubin carried on with replacements Darcy MacDonald on guitars and bassist Dave Reimer\n\nAfter touring the majority of the planet, they returned to Little Mountain and Immediately began work on the follow-up LINE OF FIRE, released in '83. Backed by the singles, &quot;Feel It (Feel My Body)&quot; and &quot;Don't Stand In The Line Of Fire&quot;, it stayed true to the course its predecessor had laid out. Other tracks included &quot;Mine All Mine&quot;, &quot;I Know What You're Thinking&quot; and &quot;Celebration&quot;, helping the album make it two straight platinum records. LINE OF FIRE not only played the same chords at varying volumes as TURN IT LOUD, but the group also showed growth and diversity with &quot;Feel It&quot;, incorporating synthesizers as well as a horn section. An extended tour ensued, seeing the band on every major event in North America and Europe, including dates with the likes of KISS, Billy Squier, Helix, Black and Blue, Streetheart, Quiet Riot and Whitesnake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1671e2c0517d483fb2ddae7a3aad5abb824274","amp;dn":"Headpins+-+Line+Of+Fire+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1671e2c0517d483fb2ddae7a3aad5abb824274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,22,113,226,192,81,125,72,63,178,221,174,122,58,173,90,187,130,66,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
