Permanently Add ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInstall PKGsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the XMB\n\n\n    Say whaaat? If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re following KaKaRoTo you know exactly whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up:\n\n    First CFW working. \n        Grabthen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ./create_cfw.sh PS3UPDAT.355.PUP CFW.PUPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\tPermanently adds ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œinstall pkg filesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ menu.\n\n    IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m playing with it nowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll report back later. In the meantime:\n\n    Download ps3 utilities and ps3 tools from github / team fail0verflow:\n\n       # git clone https://github.com/kakaroto/ps3utils.git\n       # cd ps3utils\n       # make\n       # cd ..\n       # git clone git://git.fail0verflow.com/ps3tools.git\n       # cd ps3tools\n       # make\n       # cp pkg unpkg ../ps3utils\n\n    Grab the PS3 encryption/decryption/signing keys from github:\n\n        # git clone https://github.com/kakaroto/ps3keys.git ~/.ps3\n\n    Download PS3 3.55 (or whatever official firmware PUP) from here\n    Extract and copy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPS3UPDAT.PUPÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œps3utilsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ directory\n    Create the PS3 Custom Firmware (CFW) from the original/official update (OFW):\n\n        # cd ps3utils\n        # ./create_cfw.sh PS3UPDAT.PUP CFW.PUP\n\n    Copy and rename CFW.PUP to a USB storage device keeping this directory structure in mind: /PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP\n    Connect that USB device to your PS3 and install from Settings -&gt; System Update\n\n    If youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re currently running 3.41 (or earlier) you can either remain there and create \n    a specific CFW PUP for that version, or you can upgrade to a later PS3 firmware version, \n    like 3.55 for example. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s whatever original PUP file you use ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ only you cannot flash \n    a version lower than the current version installed on your PS3. So if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re already at 3.55, \n    where youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re unable to downgrade, then for the moment you have no other choice but \n    CFW (or OFW) 3.55. 3.41 on the other hand: upgrade or create CFW 3.41 and for the interim \n    youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still able to jailbreak and run unsigned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“brews. See the other notes below.\n\n    Other things to note:\n\n    This CFW does not modify the kernel in any way, meaning all the current compiled \n    homebrew out there will not install or run using ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œInstall Package FilesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the XMB.\n    With the above point in mind you should know this CFW does not enable piracy. \n    No piracy, no backups ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ straight homebrew.\n    Current PS3 homebrew and new homebrew will need to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œretailÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ packaged and signed; \n    thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll happen with fail0verflowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tools.\n    This is only the beginning. Prepare yourself for utter and absolute awesomeness.\n\nUpdate: Flashing 3.55-KaKaRoTo now!\nUpdate: And success! She flashed without bricking! Mind you, as jjolano reports via the \n\tcomments, many XMB items under the GAME menu are missing: Trophies, Game Data Utility, \n\tSave Data, etcÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Games (disc loaded) still boot, install and play however. \n\tIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m online with PSN too. Go Netflix!\n\nUpdate: IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve converted two PUPs for you: 3.55 and 3.41. Grab ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“em.\n\nUpdate: Depending on your situation you may need to install the CFW PUP from the PS3 Recovery Menu. \n\tTo do that, follow these steps:\n\n\tEnsure the PS3UPDAT.PUP is in /PS3/UPDATE/ on your USB device.\n\tPower down the PS3.\n\tNow press and hold the power button, the system will startup and shutdown again.\n\tRelease the power button, then press &amp; hold power again, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll hear one beep followed \n\tby two consecutive beeps.\n\tRelease power then follow the on-screen instructions. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re now in the recovery menu.\n\tConnect the USB device and select ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSystem Update.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\tHope for the best.\n\n\tThanks for the tip, Carlos. Note: you can restore OFW using the above method too.\n\nUpdate: KaKaRoTo has fixed the missing XMB menu items and also enabled is PS1/PS2 support \n\tfor backward compatible models. So here are new PUPs for your flashing pleasure.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nBinary files:\n\n* PS3 CFW 3.41\n\nFilename: PS3_341-KAKAROTO_CFW.RAR\nSize: 167.17MB\nDownloads: 4,333\n\nDescription:\nPS3 Custom Firmware 3.41. \nCreated using KaKaRoTo's PS3 CFW Creator. \nPermanently adds &quot;Install Package Files&quot; to the XMB for retail/signed PKGs only.\n\n----------\n\n* PS3 CFW 3.55\n\nFilename: PS3_355-KAKAROTO_CFW.RAR\nSize: 170.71MB\nDownloads: 8,401\n\nDescription:\n\nPS3 Custom Firmware 3.55. \nCreated using KaKaRoTo's PS3 CFW Creator. \nPermanently adds &quot;Install Package Files&quot; to the XMB for retail/signed PKGs only.\n\n\n--------------\n\n* fail0verflow PS3 Tools for Win32\n\nFilename: fail0verflow_ps3tools_win32.zip\nSize: 1.47MB\nDownloads: 6,821\n\nDescription:\nAn early build of fail0verflow's PS3 tools for Windows.
