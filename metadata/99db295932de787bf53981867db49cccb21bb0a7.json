Taylor&amp;#039;s silky voice and several catchy arrangements, R&amp;B fans regard their true glory days as the 1970s. The New Jersey-based ensemble patented a jazz-tinged funk approach keyed by Robert &quot;Kool&quot; Bell&amp;#039;s basslines, red-hot horn lines, chunky keyboards and guitar riffs, and functional vocals. Although they seldom ventured beyond the R&amp;B charts during this era, their music had far more bite than their later pop hits. These 16 cuts pay homage to Kool &amp; the Gang&amp;#039;s funk roots, and should be a revelation to those who only know them as the light ensemble behind J.T. Taylor. \n\n\n\n&amp;#039;In these songs, Horns were the lead singers and the heavy bass drove the funk!&amp;#039;\n\n\n\n\n\n01.
