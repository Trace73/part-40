As Stan &quot;The Man&quot; says of the super villians in this volume, &quot;Sure, I know they're evil.  Sure, I know they're up to no good.  Sure, I know they're a threat to our wallets, our freedoms, and they may be injurious to our health.  But I've always been fascinated by the villians.  And you've got to admit, our heroes need them as much as they need Blue Cross!&quot;\n\nIncluded in this expose of evil are Doctor Doom, Marvel's answer to Professor Moriarity; the Red Skull, the only baddie created before the Marvel Age of Comics; the Green Goblin, a bad guy when he's not being a good guy, and a devoted father; and Mephisto, the complete entity of evil.  BRING ON THE BAD GUYS is another valiant volume in the Marvel saga: the super villians strike back!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cfa97a014d7d3a843b1a0fec6623b850f433605","amp;dn":"Bring+on+the+Bad+Guys+Revised+Edition+%281998%29+%5BMarvel%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cfa97a014d7d3a843b1a0fec6623b850f433605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,250,151,160,20,215,211,168,67,177,160,254,198,98,59,133,15,67,54,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
