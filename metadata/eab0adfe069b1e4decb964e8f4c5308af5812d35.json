Led by guitarist/writer Ron Elliott, the Brummels made a virtue of innocence and joyful bounce, and benefited from Sly Stone's energetic production. Hits include &quot;Laugh, Laugh,&quot; &quot;Sad Little Girl,&quot; and a pleasant take on the Bob Dylan song &quot;One Too Many Mornings.&quot; There may not be much substance or invention here, but 30 years later, the Brummels still sound catchy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab0adfe069b1e4decb964e8f4c5308af5812d35","amp;dn":"The+Beau+Brummels+-+The+Best+of+1964-1968+%5BBrit+Pop+Rhino+SHQ+VB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab0adfe069b1e4decb964e8f4c5308af5812d35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,176,173,254,6,155,30,77,236,185,100,232,244,197,48,138,245,129,45,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
