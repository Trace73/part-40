The President of the United States has not yet been briefed. Scientists from all over the world are being assembled inside Pyramid Base. The Manipulator is General Bushnell, head of a secret organization which has been trying to capture a flying saucer since the early days of the UFO mystery. Suave but utterly ruthless this cold warrior has every tool of high-tech wizardry at his fingertips and a crack team of skilled operatives under his control. The investigator is Peter Keller, a dedicated journalist with a lot to prove, struggling to keep his integrity in the sensational atmosphere of tabloid media. A flawed but gusty professional, he's ready to travel to the ends of the Earth to solve the mystery of UFO abductions. The victim is Rachel Rand, a young woman caught between the nightmarish alien beings who stalked her on a lonely Long Island road and a bizarre cult of UFO believers who are convinced that the end of the world is imminent. Can she trust the man she loves to help her discover the truth about her tormentors?\n\nNow an unearthly craft has been secretly captured by the scientific team of General Bushnell. What it contains can indeed spell the end of human history as we know it. But are human beings ready for that knowledge? And who will control it? \n\n-----------------------------------\n\nFirst three pages of 'Analysis by Jack Sarfatti of the real UFO physics implied in Fastwalker':\n\nI met Jacques Vallee in 1975 or so. He was on the periphery of the Physics Consciousness Research Group working with Ira Einhorni and came to several of our gatherings. Saul-Paul Sirag and I took him to Francis Ford CoppolaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s house in 1976 with Uri Geller. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s how Jacques connected with Stephen Spielberg and became the\ntechnical consultant to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œClose Encounters of the Third Kind.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The character Francois Truffaut plays in the film is based on Vallee. Truffaut was working with another late friend of mine Jean Reisser Nadal. Some of that story is in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDestiny Matrix.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ValleeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sci-fi novel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFastwalkerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Mel TormeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son, Tracy (of TV sci-fi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSlidersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on parallel universes) is based on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfactÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ very much like Esalen founder, Michael MurphyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s novel about the Russian Psi Movement in the Cold War ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn End to Ordinary HistoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is not really pure fiction. I lived in the apartment on Telegraph Hill on 2 Whiting Place that Michael describes as Jacob AtabetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s abode. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAtabetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is obvious code for Qabalistic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAleph-BaytÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ alphabet soup. (Grin). Michael lived there before me and I got the place from him. Vallee and Torme describe the same kinds of phenomena in their novel that Eric Davis lists in his MUFON 2001 paper. Vallee today is a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who publicly claims he no longer does UFO research yet he, until recently at least, advised Las Vegas Real Estate Tycoon Robert Bigelow on the subject in BigelowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s NIDS project where Eric Davis had been working when he wrote the MUFON 2001 paper. Vallee continues to attend select meetings on UFOs and has been less than candid here. Here are some tantalizing snippets from the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnovelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with my comments. Thanks to Robert Jones of the Caffe Trieste Irregulars who did the background research for me here on ValleeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s essentially factual report thinly disguised as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œscience-fiction.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nMK-ULTRA at Cornell?\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMK-ULTRA had been approved by Allen Dulles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ on April 13, 1953ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ P. 50\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey signed up Cornell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ P. 50\n\n\nI arrived at Cornell at age 17 on full scholarship arranged by Walter Breen who was working on a gifted children project under Professor William Sheldon of Columbia\nUniversity Psychology Department financed by Eugene Mc Dermott, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, with strong ties to US Intelligence from WWII. Phil Morrison, one of\nthe founders of SETI was my advisor. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs early as April 9, 1952 you will find a memo that suggested looking at the influence of drugs on human paranormal abilities.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ P. 52\n\nPuharich in the Army working on psychedelics in early 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dr. Andrija Puharich did that work for the Army at that time. I later met Puharich in 1974 during my involvement with Uri Geller as told by Martin Gardner in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMagic and ParaphysicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Star Gate ConspiracyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Picknett and Prince and in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDestiny Matrix.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Walter Breen attempted to induce paranormal powers in us kids (1954 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 56), although no drugs were used. Agents allegedly from New Mexico who I met monitored his project. I also met CIA Chief of Station Harold Chipman in mid 80ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s who was very much part of this project. Chipman wrote some of the episodes in the TV series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe EnforcerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ based on his CIA career. He also wrote a treatment for a screen play ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe UnionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ about a rogue CIA group like ValleeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlintelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ using remote viewing against the Soviets. He was an important part of MK ULTRA going back to the fifties and had a hand in the SRI remote-viewing (RV) project of Puthoff and Targ with astronaut Edgar\nMitchell and Brendan O Regan. Police Commissioner Pat Price was a close associate of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChipÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Price was a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of the RV project along with Uri Geller and Ingo Swann.  Puthoff was not aware of ChipmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s role in what he was doing at the time.\n\nAlien Intelligence\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlintel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Alien Intelligence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Who would form a unit like that? ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ A president ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ designed Alintel as a black project: No records, no traces, no bureaucratic trails ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The UFO phenomenon has turned out to be far more complex than anyone had dreamed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo you believe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOh we knew that from the start ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ P. 86\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a rogue element ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Newcomers are being brought in- military men, scientific types.
