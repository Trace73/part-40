Dubbed by some as Mad Max meets Bambi, it takes place in a mostly rural post-apocalyptic setting where some creatures are human/animal hybrids. Although the story is initially set in Nebraska, the landscape is inspired by Lemires past home of Essex County. \n\nSweet Tooth, as a post-apocalyptic parable, is rife with influences such as Tim Trumans Scout: War Shaman and the Winterworld three issue mini-series.As well as art influence by Richard Corbens A Boy and His Dog written by Harlan Ellison and The Punisher: The End, written by Garth Ennis.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAkMAAAdc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DAkMAAAdc&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy comics thread at suprbay &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=102652&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=102652&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43134a3d46105a22743f22dd738bf2d85443ac00","amp;dn":"Sweet+Tooth+%231-25%28ongoing%29.Vertigo+comics+2009-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43134a3d46105a22743f22dd738bf2d85443ac00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,19,74,61,70,16,90,34,116,63,34,221,115,139,242,216,84,67,172,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
