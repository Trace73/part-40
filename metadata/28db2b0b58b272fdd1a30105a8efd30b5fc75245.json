Each of these episodes is an avi format video. Also, there is another fella with some of the same earlier episodes who just posted up. These 7  episodes are ripped from DVD so they may be missing a minute of two that would probably be complete from the VHS versions. I don't know why they do that, but sometimes they trim the shows a bit when they release sets on DVD. Anyway, just want to make people aware of the different options.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28db2b0b58b272fdd1a30105a8efd30b5fc75245","amp;dn":"Lone+Ranger+TV+Show+Eps+07-13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28db2b0b58b272fdd1a30105a8efd30b5fc75245","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,219,43,11,88,178,114,253,209,163,1,5,168,239,211,11,95,199,82,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
