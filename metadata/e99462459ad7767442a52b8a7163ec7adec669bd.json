To prevent the Huns from engaging in any more fighting, the Yanks disarm the citizens of all their weapons, including lances. U.S. Rocket Tanks - In the Rhine offensive, giant U.S. tanks mounting 60 rocket tubes lay down terrific rocket barrages either in salvo, or in rapid fire. Zweibrucken Captured - Gen. 'Iron Mike' O'Daniel's U.S. 3rd Infantry virtually razes this Nazi industrial and mining center before they enter it and round up all the civilians and bitter young Nazi troupers.

Now A.M.G. takes over.&quot; scenes of civilians of captured Godesberg rounded up and questioned, same hotel where Hitler and Chamberlain met 1938, gaze at Rhine river, new rocket-firing tank unveiled.
