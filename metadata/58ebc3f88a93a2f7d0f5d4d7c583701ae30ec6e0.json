This is what Ben told Erin when he presented her and Todd with tickets to Fiji and the promise of ten days of nothing but sleeping until whenever they wanted, sex without having to lock the door and lots of alone time.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what they have. Long days and nights filled with pleasure. Long enough that the stress and exhaustion drops away and the three can simply enjoy each other.\n\nTheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got heat. More than ever before. Recharging their batteries has also brought new levels of intimacy and connection. But when Erin stumbles over the pain of her past, both men band together to not only help her through, but to help each other as well.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
