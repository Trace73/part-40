Encoded with HandBrakeCLI.\n\nThe pilot is missing because this is not included in the box set (false advertising by a&amp;e?), but a lot of the pilot was used in season 1 episode 20\n\nSeasons 4 and 5 have bleeps instead of naughty words.  Do uncensored versions of these seasons exist or did CBS keep everything clean when they took over?\n\nSeasons 1 - 3 are the completely uncensored hbo version.\n\nI haven't included all the dvd extras in this torrent because i haven't encoded it for my ipod yet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ea056252516c7e5b127ea923fc69775e7814d7","amp;dn":"The+Kids+in+the+Hall%2C+Season+1+-+5+DVDRip+for+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ea056252516c7e5b127ea923fc69775e7814d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,234,5,98,82,81,108,126,91,18,126,169,35,252,105,119,94,120,20,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
