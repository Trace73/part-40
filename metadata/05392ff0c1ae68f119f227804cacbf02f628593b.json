We revisit the infamous Galileo affair and see that it didn't unfold in quite the way we thought. We get a rare glimpse into the world of working scientists and see how scientific discoveries are proposed and advanced. We learn the inside story of the Mars meteorite: how can we be sure it's really from Mars, and why can't scientists agree on whether or not it contains evidence of life? Brother Astronomer memorably sets forth one scientist's conviction that the universe may be worth studying only if it is the work of a Creator God.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05392ff0c1ae68f119f227804cacbf02f628593b","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2001%5D+Brother+Astronomer+Adventures+of+a+Vatican+Scientis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05392ff0c1ae68f119f227804cacbf02f628593b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,57,47,240,193,174,104,241,25,242,39,128,76,172,191,2,246,40,89,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
