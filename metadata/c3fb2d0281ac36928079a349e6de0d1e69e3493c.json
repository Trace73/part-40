However, when a disgraced agent reappears with information concerning a mole at the heart of the service, Smiley is drawn back into the murky field of espionage. Tasked with investigating which of his trusted former colleagues has chosen to betray him and their country, Smiley narrows his search to four suspects - all experienced, skilled and successful agents - but past histories, rivalries and friendships make it far from easy to pinpoint the man who is eating away at the heart of the British establishment.\n\nAn acting masterclass from the crÃƒÂ¨me de la crÃƒÂ¨me of British film (Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Tom Hardy (Inception), Mark Strong (Kick Ass), Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock) and inspired direction from Let the Right One InÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tomas Alfredson make this gripping and tense adaptation of John le CarrÃƒÂ©Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s classic spy novel essential viewing.\n\nPlease SEED!
