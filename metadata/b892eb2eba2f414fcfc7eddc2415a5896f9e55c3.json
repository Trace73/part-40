Once again Hela makes an appearance; and the scene is amazing in both animation and dialogue. The episode overall is, once again, a fantastic piece of\nstorytelling with amazing artwork, but the ending was weak. Mostly it's because I felt for Loki as a character and he seemed cheated in the end, but it also could \nhave been due to the whole anticlimactic way it was approached; they built up the episode only to have it just end so suddenly.\nThe series is phenomenal, period. From start to finish the series delivers beautiful artwork -- that blends elements of a motion comic with CG animation, great \ncharacter development of Loki, and an awesome voice cast. This has become a definite new favorite of mine, and not only has this series brought me tremendous \nanticipation for future projects by Marvel Knights but also has given me a new love for the Thor villain and piqued enough fascination for me to begin indulging in \nthe Thor comic series.\n[i](from h**p://www.dailyblam.com/)[/i]\n\nPart four introduces us to Loki's biological mother, which felt a bit \nSpoken Language, English\n\nh**p://www.imdb.com/news/ni9733920/\n======================================================\n\nScreens:\n----------\n\n[URL=http://img685.imageshack.us/i/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg/][IMG]http://img685.imageshack.us/img685/4919/thorlokibloodbrotherss0.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n======================================================\n\nFile Info\n-------------\n\nFormAT:- AVI\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 170M\nPlayTime           : 00:16:23.783\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : DX50\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 420 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 29.970fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 29484\nVideoBitRate       : 1317059\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\nNote:-\n--------\n\n=================================================\n\nHash:\n------\nB892EB2EBA2F414FCFC7EDDC2415A5896F9E55C3\n==================================================\n[/center]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b892eb2eba2f414fcfc7eddc2415a5896f9e55c3","amp;dn":"Thor.%26.Loki.Blood.Brothers.S01E04-Divx-%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b892eb2eba2f414fcfc7eddc2415a5896f9e55c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,146,235,46,186,47,65,79,207,199,237,220,36,21,165,137,111,158,85,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
