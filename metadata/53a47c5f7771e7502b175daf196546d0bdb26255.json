Who would YOU choose? &quot;\n\n       - Tagline, &quot;My Faith in Frankie&quot; issue one\n\n &quot; Frankie is adorable like a young Audrey Hepburn. &quot;\n\n       - The Washington Post\n\n---\n\nSo, this is what's generically called a &quot;romantic comedy with a supernatural twist&quot;. Which sounds really lame, but is actually one of the most irreverently hilarious comics I've ever read, in a &quot;Calvin and Hobbes meet Terry Pratchett&quot; kind of way.\n\nThe required rom-com feel-good factor is definitely there as well, though. Really, the only criticism I can come up with is that the book is too bloody short - the premise could easily have supported something with a bit more heft, in my estimation.\n\nIf the author's name is not immediately familiar, Mike Carey has also written &quot;The Unwritten&quot; (pun? what pun?) and &quot;Lucifer&quot; - which, as it happens, are both contained in the latest Weeklies, woot!\n\n---\n\nThis is a single volume compiled from the Digital Hi-Res re-releases by Tithe-Empire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53a47c5f7771e7502b175daf196546d0bdb26255","amp;dn":"Mike+Carey%3A+My+Faith+in+Frankie+%28Vertigo%7C2004%7CDigital-HR%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53a47c5f7771e7502b175daf196546d0bdb26255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,164,124,95,119,113,231,80,43,23,93,175,25,101,70,208,189,178,98,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
