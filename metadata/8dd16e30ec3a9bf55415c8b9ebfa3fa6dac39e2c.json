Perhaps they're trying to restore faith in Warped Tour\nmusic releases.  Past experience with this series has garnered both good and\nbad outlooks or opinions.  The content is pretty damn solid and it's priced\nespecially low.\n\nNow, with that being said, the fact that 2 Warped Tour releases had flaws\nBURNED INTO THE DISC probably turned some people away from them.  So, I'm\nhoping they're able to put that behind them because the lineup and songs on\nthis one look so awesome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dd16e30ec3a9bf55415c8b9ebfa3fa6dac39e2c","amp;dn":"VA-Warped_Tour_2015_Compilation-2CD-2015-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dd16e30ec3a9bf55415c8b9ebfa3fa6dac39e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,209,110,48,236,58,155,245,84,21,200,185,235,250,63,166,218,195,158,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
