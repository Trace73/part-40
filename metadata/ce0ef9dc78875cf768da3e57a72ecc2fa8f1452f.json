At fifteen, he took a job washing dishes in a local comedy clubÃ¢â‚¬â€just so he could watch endless stand-up for free. At sixteen, he was hosting a show for his local high school radio station in Syosset, Long IslandÃ¢â‚¬â€a show that consisted of Q&amp;As with his comedy heroes, from Garry Shandling to Jerry Seinfeld. They talked about their careers, the science of a good joke, and their dreams of future glory (turns out, Shandling was interested in having his own TV show one day and Steve Allen had already invented everything).\n\nThirty years later, Apatow is still that same comedy nerdÃ¢â‚¬â€and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still interviewing funny people about why they do what they do.\n\nSick in the Head gathers ApatowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most memorable and revealing conversations into one hilarious, wide-ranging, and incredibly candid collection that spans not only his career but his entire adult life. Here are the comedy legends who inspired and shaped him, from Mel Brooks to Steve Martin. Here are the contemporaries he grew up with in Hollywood, from Spike Jonze to Sarah Silverman. And here, finally, are the brightest stars in comedy today, many of whom Apatow has been fortunate to work with, from Seth Rogen to Amy Schumer. And along the way, something kind of magical happens: What started as a lifetimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of conversations about comedy becomes something else entirely. It becomes an exploration of creativity, ambition, neediness, generosity, spirituality, and the joy that comes from making people laugh.\n\nLoaded with the kind of back-of-the-club stories that comics tell one another when no one else is watching, this fascinating, personal (and borderline-obsessive) book is Judd ApatowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift to comedy nerds everywhere.\n\nPraise for* Sick in the Head\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Open this book anywhere, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re bound to find some interesting nugget from someone who has had you in stitches many, many times.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½*Ã¢â‚¬â€Janet Maslin, The New York Times\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Incandescent . . . an irresistible, ultimate-insiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comedy-interview extravaganza . . . Apatow never loses his unabashed fanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enthusiasm even as he asks canny questions that yield superbly illuminating conversations rich in shop talk and musings on the lure, demands, and resonance of comedy.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Booklist (starred review)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If ApatowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gift for comedy is a sickness, may he never be cured.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€*Playboy\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sprawling and insightful . . . The candidness of the interviews also exposes the peculiar community of comedians with anecdotes and cameos unlikely to be heard elsewhere. A delightful and hilarious read for anyone interested in what makes comedians tick.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½*Ã¢â‚¬â€Kirkus Reviews\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“These are wonderful, expansive interviewsÃ¢â‚¬â€at times brutal, at times breathtakingÃ¢â‚¬â€with artists whose wit, intelligence, gaze, and insights are all sharp enough to draw blood.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Michael Chabon\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Anyone even remotely interested in comedy or humanity should own this book. It is hilarious and informative and it contains insightful interviews with the greatest comics, comedians, and comediennes of our time. My representatives assure me I will appear in a future edition.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Will Ferrell","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce0ef9dc78875cf768da3e57a72ecc2fa8f1452f","amp;dn":"Sick+in+the+Head+-+Judd+Apatow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce0ef9dc78875cf768da3e57a72ecc2fa8f1452f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,14,249,220,120,135,92,247,104,218,62,87,167,46,204,47,168,241,69,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
