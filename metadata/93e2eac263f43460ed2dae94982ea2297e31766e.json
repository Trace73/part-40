Its original form, as preached by Gautama in India and developed in the early years succeeding, and as embodied in the sacred literature of early Buddhism, is not representative of the actual Buddhism of any land today. The faithful student of Buddhist literature would be as far removed from understanding the working activities of a busy center of Buddhism in Burma, Tibet or China today as a student of patristic literature would be from appreciating the Christian life of London or New York City.\n\nBuddhism and Buddhists in China is an anthropological text describing Buddhism as practiced in China at the beginning of the 20th Century. Interestingly, it also compares and contrasts Buddhism with Christianity with respect to or in response to missionary work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e2eac263f43460ed2dae94982ea2297e31766e","amp;dn":"Buddhism+and+Buddhists+in+China+by+Lewis+Hodous+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e2eac263f43460ed2dae94982ea2297e31766e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,226,234,194,99,244,52,96,237,45,174,148,152,46,162,41,126,49,118,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
