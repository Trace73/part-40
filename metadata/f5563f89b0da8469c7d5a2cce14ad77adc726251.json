Let the River Take Them Home, pushes towards popular mainstream music in the vein of Murder by Death. Combining brilliant songwriting with empassioned performances with a dark mask over each song creates a beautiful album moving past niche genres to epic big rock sound.\n\nThese are songs that have real meaning and depth and are presented to the listener in a way that sparks imagery and soul in every note and phrase. A great record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5563f89b0da8469c7d5a2cce14ad77adc726251","amp;dn":"Pinebox+Serenade+-+Let+The+River+Take+Them+Home+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5563f89b0da8469c7d5a2cce14ad77adc726251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,86,63,137,176,218,132,105,199,213,162,204,225,74,215,122,220,114,98,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
