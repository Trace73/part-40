Just Kids\n\n  A spiral of heavily processed vocals is the sound that begins Wild Peace, the debut full-length from South London shoegaze duo Echo Lake. The delayed melody lingers a little bit before sharp organ tones and burnished guitars amble in, eventually coagulating into the lushly woozy album opener, &quot;Further Down.&quot; The relatively short tune still manages to seamlessly introduce layer after layer of sound, ending abruptly in a much bigger place than it started. Throughout Wild Peace, Echo Lake's greatest gift is their ability to marry strong songwriting to sonic micro-management, decorating their wistful and sometimes dour pop tunes with constant peripheral motion in atmosphere and production. The album's range is indicative of its perpetual push, too. Starting out with the blissfully summery, pop-like &quot;Another Day&quot; or the cloudy title track, the band switches gears on &quot;Even the Blind,&quot; taking Linda Jarvis' multi-tracked vocals out of the murky reverb haze and dropping them in the dead center of the band's most immediate and driving number. Jarvis' presence on much of the album is in the form of ghostly whispers or underwater cooing, and &quot;Even the Blind&quot; acknowledges this by burying the vocals on the verses in a fashion typical of the rest of the album before peeling back a layer of reverb and upping their volume remarkably for the choruses. The effect is just short of shocking, and works to accentuate an already catchy song by driving the chorus that much further into your brain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:878cf733be629e99cdda9f8645bf45ecfbabc822","amp;dn":"Echo+Lake+-+Wild+Peace+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"878cf733be629e99cdda9f8645bf45ecfbabc822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,140,247,51,190,98,158,153,205,218,159,134,69,191,69,236,251,171,200,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
