Epi-Primate (4:59)\n2. One Below The Pyre (3:40)\n3. Keepers Of The Caste (4:34)\n4. Hidden Track (2:48)\n\nPÃƒï¿½R; Greek for Ã¢â‚¬ËœfireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, is as its title suggests: a harrowing and bleak commentary on the world of today and the contagion of greed and corruption that has swept around the globe.\n\nMusically; the band has evolved from their debut EP From The River I Come, To The Desert I Go to deliver a more direct and confronting sound, albeit with the same emphasis on atmospherics and ambience. Sub-bass synths, haunting keyboard samples and primal sequenced rhythms meld with distorted ring modded guitars and a thumping machine-like rhythm section, creating a style of grimy, reverberant industrial rock unlike any other. But lyrically, the band still delivers the same dark imagery and underlying thematic connections that made their debut EP a stand out.\n\nLead single Epi-Primate gutturally announces the EP as it weaves mysterious synth lines over a vicious pounding beat. One Below The Pyre immediately commands the listenerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention with its crushing industrial rhythm and haunting vocal lines whilst Keepers Of The Caste features ominous synth pulses and a devastating crescendo. And perhaps as testament to the creativity of the band and diversity that they bring to their music, the final hidden track is what it is; a striking mix of tribal shouts and atonal noise propelled by a cacophony of metallic sequences that has to be heard to be understood.\n\nAll songs written by Heytesburg\nProduced by Heytesburg and Matt Gio\nEngineered by Matt Gio at Underground and Couch Studios\nMastered by Simon Struthers at Forensic Audio\nArtwork by Deerandfoxdesign.
