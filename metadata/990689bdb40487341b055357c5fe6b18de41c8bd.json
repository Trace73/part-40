It is also a blueprint for regaining controlof our media, so that they can serve our highest goals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:990689bdb40487341b055357c5fe6b18de41c8bd","amp;dn":"Neil+Postman+-+2005+-+Amusing+Ourselves+to+Death+-+Public+Discou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"990689bdb40487341b055357c5fe6b18de41c8bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,6,137,189,180,4,135,52,27,5,83,87,197,254,107,24,222,65,200,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
