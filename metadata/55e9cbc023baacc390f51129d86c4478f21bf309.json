The remnants of their ancient power lie dormant and a new conflict threatens the kingdom of AntiaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nKing Daris rules a peaceful and prosperous land, but his conniving brother Jerim covets the throne and civil war looms.\nBut there are worse threats to Antia than mere human greed.\nTwo people will stand against mortal and demonic enemies: Alyda Stenna, Captain of the Hammer of Antia returns from campaign to a heroÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s welcome after prosecuting war abroad with brutal efficiency.\nGarian Tain, the spymasterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apprentice, hunts for an assassin through the streets of the capital while the knights bask in the adoration of the crowds.\nThis is just the beginning.\nBoth will fight overwhelming odds in a bid to save the kingdom. War and betrayal will test them to their limits. One will rise; one will fall; both will be changed forever.\nGenre: Epic Fantasy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55e9cbc023baacc390f51129d86c4478f21bf309","amp;dn":"The+Red+Knight+-+Davies%2C+K.T_.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55e9cbc023baacc390f51129d86c4478f21bf309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,233,203,192,35,186,172,195,144,245,17,41,216,108,68,120,242,27,243,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
