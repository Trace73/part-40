The band was founded in 1973 by guitarist Randy Rhoads and bassist Kelly Garni under the original name Mach 1, before changing the name to Little Women and finally Quiet Riot in May 1975. The band's name was inspired by a conversation with Rick Parfitt of the British band Status Quo, in which Parfitt said he'd like to name a band &quot;Quite Right&quot;,[1] and his thick English accent made it sound like he was saying &quot;Quiet Riot&quot;.[2] The band is ranked at No. 100 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.[citation needed]\n\nThe original line-up featured Rhoads and Garni with lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth. Their most commercially successful lineup consisted of DuBrow alongside guitarist Carlos Cavazo, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Frankie Banali, and in 1983 released their breakthrough album Metal Health, which is known for being the first heavy metal album to top the Billboard album chart. Despite several lineup changes and brief breakups, Quiet Riot continued to record and tour until DuBrow's death from an accidental cocaine overdose in 2007.[3] Banali revived the band in 2010, and the current lineup consists of himself on drums, lead vocalist Jizzy Pearl, bassist Chuck Wright and guitarist Alex Grossi.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0782c84a399f3206fe38f8f29fff09f949707c6","amp;dn":"Quiet+Riot+%28usa%29+discography+1975+-+2014+by+susan1973","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0782c84a399f3206fe38f8f29fff09f949707c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,120,44,132,163,153,243,32,111,227,143,143,41,255,240,159,148,151,7,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
