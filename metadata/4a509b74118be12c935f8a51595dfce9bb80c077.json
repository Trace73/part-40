I had to reload and rewatch the ~30 second ad. The result is that the start of this after show is missing. I tried waiting a few days for it to be posted on their website but no such luck.\n\nThis is basically 480p widescreen. Recorded with Replay Video Catcher from FoxBusiness.com. Converted with AviDemux using Mpeg4 AVC (x264) &amp; AAC (Faac). Downsized to 720x404, then cropped. Hence the oblong resolution. The black bars on the sides that come and go are due to the web player I rip these from.  I have nothing to do with the scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a509b74118be12c935f8a51595dfce9bb80c077","amp;dn":"The.Independents.After.Show.2014.06.30.WS.WEB-DL.x264.XAiO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a509b74118be12c935f8a51595dfce9bb80c077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,80,155,116,17,139,225,44,147,95,138,81,89,93,252,233,187,128,192,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
