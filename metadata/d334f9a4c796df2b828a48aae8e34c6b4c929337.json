Highlights include &quot;The Way You Look Tonight,&quot; &quot;Lover Man,&quot; &quot;Stars Fell on Alabama&quot; and &quot;The Song Is You.&quot; ~ Keith Farley, All Music Guide \n\nCannonball Adderley is celebrated very nicely on &quot;Verve Jazz Masters&quot; 31.  Many of the songs are standards, such as &quot;You'd be so Nice to Come Home To&quot; and &quot;The Song is You&quot;.  Adderley has been called &quot;The New Bird&quot; for his Charlie Parker-esque sound on the alto.  This is a beautiful album with beautiful sidemen.  Cannonball is backed so nicely on many of the tracks by his trumpeter brother, Nat.  One of the high points of this album is his unique cover of Monk's &quot;Straight, no Chaser&quot;.  Anyone who has ever wondered about Cannonball will learn a lot from this &quot;introductory&quot; album.  The purpose of the Verve Jazz Masters albums is to present an introduction to the work of whoever they are recording.  They have recorded Adderley very nicely, and this is an album for any of Cannonball's fans, or any fan of great jazz music. ~ David Marshall\n\nClassic hard bop form a wellspring of alto inpiration.  Along with Coltrane, Rollins and Miles, Adderley is a perfoming giant.  This is a great all around sample of his work.  His work with Miles on 'Something Else' is one of the must haves in jazz. ~ Steven A Erger\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 31 - Cannonball Adderley Tracks:\n01  WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s New? 5:03 \n02  The Song Is You 4:18 \n03  IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Glad There Is You 2:35 \n04  YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Be So Nice To Come Home To 3:42 \n05  CynthiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s In Love 3:10 \n06  The Masquerade Is Over 3:13 \n07  Limehouse Blues 4:42 \n08  Lover Man (Oh, Where Can You Be) 3:57 \n09  Stars Fell On Alabama 6:17 \n10  Street Of Dreams 2:15 \n11  Spring Is Here 3:48 \n12  The Way You Look Tonight 4:27 \n13  Falling In Love With Love 2:33 \n14  Little Girl Blue 2:42 \n15  I Got It Bad (And That AinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Good) 2:38 \n16  Straight No Chaser 8:23 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d334f9a4c796df2b828a48aae8e34c6b4c929337","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+31+-+Cannonball+Adderley+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d334f9a4c796df2b828a48aae8e34c6b4c929337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,52,249,164,199,150,223,43,130,138,72,170,232,227,76,107,76,146,147,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
