Barry Forshaw's lively and scholarly study moves from the sexual abandon of the silent era and the 1930s through the enforced innocence resulting from the restrictive Hays Code (and the ingenious attempts by filmmakers to circumvent censorship) and the demolition of taboos by arthouse directors such as Ingmar Bergman in the 1950s and 1960s. The book highlights all the key moments in this incendiary area, including the shocking exploitation and pornographic movies of the 1970s, while a discussion of the graphic and explicit imagery of today's mainstream cinema takes the book up to the present â€“ and beyond.\r\n\r\n**PLEASE SEED**","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2bc620ffeeb398894a0627b54ef614b31c0331","amp;dn":"Sex+and+Film+The+Erotic+in+British%2C+American+and+World+Cinema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2bc620ffeeb398894a0627b54ef614b31c0331","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,43,198,32,255,238,179,152,137,74,6,39,181,78,246,20,179,28,3,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
