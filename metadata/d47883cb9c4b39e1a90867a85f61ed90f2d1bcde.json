The families' six year old daughters, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go for a walk outside with their older siblings, Ralph Dover and Eliza Birch. The children have to be forcefully pulled away from a parked RV by their siblings when they start climbing on it. After dinner, the younger daughters leave to go back to Anna's house to get her safety whistle she is supposed to carry at all times, but they never come back. After a police hunt, the RV is found parked outside a gas station next to a wooded area. When Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal), who heads the case, goes to confront the RV's driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), Alex panics, tries to speed away, and crashes into the trees.\n\nAlex is taken in for questioning, but it is found that he has the IQ of a 10-year-old and rarely speaks. No forensic evidence is found in the RV and Alex's low intelligence means he couldn't have covered up such evidence. Also, polygraph tests of him prove inconclusive due to his low IQ, and he repeatedly denies ever having seen the children. Detective Loki goes to see Alex's aunt, Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), who raised him with his uncle after his parents died when he was six. Alex's uncle left the home a couple years ago after a domestic dispute with his aunt. Alex spends most nights sleeping in the RV and does not have many things. As the police are unable to find evidence against Alex, he is released in two days. Keller attacks him in a parking lot where he says Alex tells him, &quot;They only cried when I left them.&quot; Though no one is close enough to hear this to corroborate, Keller takes this as proof that Alex took the girls.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d47883cb9c4b39e1a90867a85f61ed90f2d1bcde","amp;dn":"Prisoners+TSCamRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d47883cb9c4b39e1a90867a85f61ed90f2d1bcde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,120,131,203,156,75,57,225,169,8,103,168,95,97,237,144,242,209,188,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
