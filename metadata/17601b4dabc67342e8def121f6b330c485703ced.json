All the members are wealthy and eccentric, and all the staff are poor and slightly less eccentric. The main character is 'Danny'; he's a caddy who will do almost anything to raise money to go to college. There are many subplots, including the assistant green keeper's pursuit of a cute (obviously stuffed) gopher.\n\n\nRated: R\nRuntime: 98 min\nGenres: Comedy/Sport \nLanguage: English/Spanish/French \nSubs: English/Spanish/French/Japanese\nCompression: DVD Shrink\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease Do Not Hit and Run......Please Seed..Thank You, Gratesse.....     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Gratesse&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Gratesse&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17601b4dabc67342e8def121f6b330c485703ced","amp;dn":"Caddyshack+-+1980+NTSC+-+Gratesse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17601b4dabc67342e8def121f6b330c485703ced","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,96,27,77,171,198,115,66,232,222,241,33,246,179,48,196,133,112,60,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
