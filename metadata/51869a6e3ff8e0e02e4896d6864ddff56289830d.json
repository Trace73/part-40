Concise and readable, it provides theoretical background, application materials, and details of recent progress. Exploring several effective design approaches, this book covers a wide scope, making it an ideal hands-on resource for professionals seeking a refresher in the fundamentals. It also provides the basic grounding in antenna essentials that is required for those new to the field.\nThe bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primary focus is on introducing practical techniques that will enable users to make optimal use of powerful commercial software packages and computational electromagnetics used in full wave analysis and antenna design. Going beyond particular numerical computations to teach broader concepts, the author systematically presents the all-important spectral domain approach to analyzing microstrip structures including antennas. In addition to a discussion of near-field measurement and the high-frequency method, this book also covers:\n\n    * Elementary linear sources, including HuygenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s planar element, and analysis and synthesis of the discrete and continuous arrays formed by these elementary sources\n\n    * The digital beam-forming antenna and smart antenna\n\n    * Cavity mode theory and related issues, including the design of irregularly shaped patches and the analysis of mutual coupling\n\nBased on much of the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own internationally published research, and honed by his years of teaching experience, this text is designed to bring students, engineers, and technicians up to speed as efficiently as possible. This text purposefully emphasizes principles and includes carefully selected sample problems to ease the process of understanding the often intimidating area of antenna technology. Paying close attention to this text, you will be able to confidently emulate the authorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own systematic approach to make the most of commercial software and find the creative solutions that every job seems to require.\nAbout the Author\n\nProfessor Da-Gang Fang graduated from the graduate school of Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 1966. From 1980 to 1982, he was a visiting scholar at Laval University (Quebec, Canada), and the University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada). Since 1986, he has been a Professor at the Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NUST), Nanjing, China. Since 1987, he has been a visiting professor at six universities in Canada and in Hong Kong. He has authored and co-authored two books, two book chapters and more than 360 papers. He is also the owner of three patents. His research interests include computational electromagnetics, microwave integrated circuits and antennas and EM scattering. Prof. Fang is a Fellow of IEEE and CIE (Chinese Institute of Electronics), an associate editor of two Chinese journals and is on the Editorial or Review Board of several international and Chinese journals. He was TPC chair of ICMC 1992, vice general chair of PIERS 2004, the member of International Advisory Committee of six international conferences, TPC co-chair of APMC 2005 and general co-chair of ICMMT 2008. He was also the recipient of National Outstanding Teacher Award and PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Teacher Medal, and the Provincial Outstanding Teacher Award. His name was listed in Marquis Who is Who in the World (1995) and in International Biographical Association Directory (1995).\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 311 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (December 22, 2009)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1439807272\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1439807279","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51869a6e3ff8e0e02e4896d6864ddff56289830d","amp;dn":"Antenna+Theory+and+Microstrip+Antennas%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51869a6e3ff8e0e02e4896d6864ddff56289830d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,134,154,110,63,248,224,224,46,72,150,214,134,77,223,245,98,137,131,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
