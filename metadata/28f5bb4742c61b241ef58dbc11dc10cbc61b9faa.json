It's a lean, concise collection that tells you everything you need to know about Creedence. Several of the band's individual albums are essential, but Chronicle is not only an excellent introduction to the group, it offers definitive proof that the group was one of the definitive singles' bands of the late '60s. Rarely has a greatest- hits collection been so well-assembled.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Susie Q                                              [04:35]\n02.I put A spell on you                                 [04:31]\n03.Proud mary                                           [03:08]\n04.Bad moon rising                                      [02:20]\n05.Lodi                                                 [03:11]\n06.Green river                                          [02:33]\n07.Commotion                                            [02:43]\n08.Down on the corner                                   [02:46]\n09.Fortunate son                                        [02:19]\n10.Travelin' band                                       [02:08]\n11.WhoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¤ll stop the rain                                 [02:28]\n12.Up around the bend                                   [02:41]\n13.Run through the jungle                               [03:05]\n14.LookinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã‚Â¤ out my back door                             [02:33]\n15.Long as I can see the light                          [03:31]\n16.I heard it through the grapevine                     [11:03]\n17.Have you ever seen the rain                          [02:40]\n18.Hey tonight                                          [02:43]\n19.Sweet hitch-Hiker                                    [02:54]\n20.Someday never comes                                  [04:00]\n____\n\n67:52 min\n102,4 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28f5bb4742c61b241ef58dbc11dc10cbc61b9faa","amp;dn":"Creedence_Clearwater_Revival-Chronicle-%28Retail%29-1976-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28f5bb4742c61b241ef58dbc11dc10cbc61b9faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,245,187,71,66,198,27,36,30,245,141,188,17,220,16,203,198,27,159,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
