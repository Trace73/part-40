As you can imagine, over the years, this localized content has developed in its own directions, resulting in a wealth of good GDL - that is sadly unavailable to the rest of the world. Much of Europe wants to know what is in the USA library, and much of North America wants to know what is in the INT library. Soon, you will be able to download a single library, and discover everything (almost - weÃƒÂ¢??ll explain) you have been missing out on!\n\nFor more information - or to make a donation to the ACE projects - please visit: http://www.archicad.ca/?p=75\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:328b4a1a886c59fbeb815e4f51beabc773e0bc46","amp;dn":"ArchiCad+ACE+Library","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"328b4a1a886c59fbeb815e4f51beabc773e0bc46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,139,74,26,136,108,89,251,235,129,94,79,81,190,171,199,115,224,188,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
