The correct track position is noted in the metadata.\n\n\n\nThe MP3 file was converted from m4a @261kbps to MP3 @320. I'm aware that conversion from a lower bit rate to a higher bit rate does not improve the quality of the music, but because I prefer to present my uploads in either mp3 or FLAC, conversion from m4a was necessary and I didn't want to monkey with the settings in my conversion software to approximate the original bit rate in m4a for one song. If you REEEAAALLLLY want the original M4A file, contact me via email and I will UL.\n\n\n\n\nAll tracks will have correct ID3 tags.\n\nAll albums will have album art included if it was available to me.\n\nIf you have any problems, comments, or suggestions, let me know. \n\nIF YOU NEED FOR ME TO RESEED, contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7b080c121d0f19140c3b021a13141455181416&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy, and seed, Seed, SEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10035e738a42c79f70cc439c43d170d510a05540","amp;dn":"Robin+Loxley+%26amp%3B+Oliver+Jackson+-+Be+What+You+Want+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10035e738a42c79f70cc439c43d170d510a05540","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,3,94,115,138,66,199,159,112,204,67,156,67,209,112,213,16,160,85,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
