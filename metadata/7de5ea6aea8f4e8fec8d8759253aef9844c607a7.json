Following his extremely successful years with Deep Purple and Rainbow, he left all commercial considerations aside, founding Blackmore's Night with his partner Candice Night and devoting himself single-mindedly to his greatest passion, the music of the Middle Ages.\n\nSince then the renaissance-infused magic of Blackmore's Night has captured the hearts and minds of fans and media around the globe. With such successful albums as Fires At Midnight, Ghost of a Rose, and Beyond The Sunset: The Romantic Collection now behind them and etched into history, the band is proud to present the brand new DVD, Castles &amp; Dreams.
