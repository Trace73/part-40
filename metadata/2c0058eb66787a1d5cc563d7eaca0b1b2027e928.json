Memphis Minnie - Frankie Jean\n\n\nThis ambitious and thought-provoking project turns to early black-and-white, religious, and secular traditions for antecedents to modern rap styles.\n\nDrawing from the commercial recordings of the 1920s and '30s, The Roots of Rap provides a broad sampling of rural voices straddling the lines of speech and song against the rhythms of piano, banjo, and guitar. The roots of rap, this collection argues, existed in early black work songs and in the Southern pulpit; in the performances of singing street evangelists; and in black vocal traditions such as the &quot;dozens.&quot; Early forms of rap emerged in the vaudeville routines of minstrel and medicine shows, arising also in the country humor and talking blues of many rural white performers. To illustrate its thesis, the album draws from some of the greatest performers of the period, including Blind Willie Johnson, Seven Foot Dilly, Butterbeans and Susie, and Memphis Minnie, whose extraordinarily funky &quot;Frankie Jean&quot; closes the set. Like the best of Yazoo's projects, this effort is carefully and intelligently constructed, as well as consistently entertaining. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0058eb66787a1d5cc563d7eaca0b1b2027e928","amp;dn":"%28Blues+VA%29+The+Roots+Of+Rap+%28Classics+From+20s+and+30s%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0058eb66787a1d5cc563d7eaca0b1b2027e928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,0,88,235,102,120,122,29,92,197,99,215,234,202,11,27,32,39,233,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
