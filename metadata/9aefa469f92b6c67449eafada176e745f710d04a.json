In Florence, they preferred to accept and articulate the rational Ã¢â‚¬Å“systemÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Brunelleschi, either transforming it, like Alberti, or breaking with it in a return to tradition, like Michelozzo. In north and south Italy, the battle between innovation and resistance was increasing in strength and substance because it not only encompassed immediate questions of decorative language  (antique forms and architectural orders) but also the problems of conceiving and constructing an architecture that could replace the gothic structural membering with the continuous masonry of the Antiquity. At first, the new decoration was frequently adapted to the existing architectural system, and only later did it find a partner in the different spatial and structural conceptions that descended from Florentine exempla. The tendency to see norms and models in antique architecture, which must be rigidly replicated, first affirmed itself at the beginning of the XVI century in Rome.\n\nThrough some of the most celebrated examples of the early Renaissance architecture and the most important statements of the early Renaissance theories, the course will examine problems of the architectural spaces, technology and forms in the XV century in Italy, from Leon Battista AlbertiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to Francesco di GiorgioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and BramanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s proposals.\n\n\n\nCourse Syllabus::\n\n1.
