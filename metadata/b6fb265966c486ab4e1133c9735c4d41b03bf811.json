The album features Bruce&amp;#039;s personal\ninterpretations of thirteen traditional songs, all of them associated with the\nlegendary guiding light of American folk music, Pete Seeger, for whom the album\nis named. Speaking of the origins of the new music, Springsteen said, &quot;So much\nof my writing, particularly when I write acoustically, comes straight out of\nthe folk tradition. Making this album was creatively liberating because I have\na love of all those different roots sounds... they can conjure up a world with\njust a few notes and a few words.&quot;\n\nSpringsteen recorded the album with a large ensemble. The musicians on the\nrecord are Springsteen (guitar, harmonica, B3 organ and percussion), Sam\nBardfeld (violin), Art Baron (tuba) Frank Bruno (guitar), Jeremy Chatzy\n(upright bass), Mark Clifford (banjo), Larry Eagle (drums and percussion),\nCharles Giordano (B3 organ, piano and accordion), Ed Manion (saxophone), Mark\nPender (trumpet), Richie &quot;La Bamba&quot; Rosenberg (trombone) and Soozie Tyrell\n(violin). Lisa Lowell, Patti Scialfa, Springsteen, Pender, Tyrell, and\nRosenberg contribute backing vocals.\n\nWe Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions will be released in DualDisc format,\nwith the full album on one side of the disc and DVD content on the other side.\nThe 30 minute video side of the DualDisc contains extensive behind the scenes\nfootage of the recording of the album. In addition, the DualDisc package will\ncontain two bonus tracks and a special booklet including a note from\nSpringsteen.\n\nSpringsteen is planning a short tour in the U.S. and Europe to accompany the\nrelease of the album. He will be appearing with most of the musicians who\nappeared on the CD. Details will be announced separately.\n\nAccording to Springsteen&amp;#039;s longtime manager Jon Landau, &quot;We Shall Overcome:\nThe Seeger Sessions has a lightness and ease to it, a sheer joyfulness, that\nmakes it very special from top to bottom. Bruce has taken a core group of\nclassic American songs and transformed them into a high energy, modern and\nvery personal statement.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6fb265966c486ab4e1133c9735c4d41b03bf811","amp;dn":"Bruce_Springsteen-We_Shall_Overcome-The_Seeger_Sessions-2006-RNS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6fb265966c486ab4e1133c9735c4d41b03bf811","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,251,38,89,102,196,134,171,78,17,51,201,115,92,77,65,176,59,248,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
