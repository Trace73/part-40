Another Brick In the Wall Part 2\n15. Shine On You Crazy Diamond\n\n\nFrom www.aussiefloyd.com :  Having sold over three million tickets in concerts that have taken place in 35 countries, The Australian Pink Floyd Show is rightfully hailed as one of the most in demand touring entities currently operating, The Times described them as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Gold StandardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  This act is so good they were even engaged by David Gilmour to perform at his 50th birthday celebration! \n\nDuring an eveningÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s festivities at the Fulham Town Hall, performing Pink Floyd to the members of Pink Floyd amongst others. Toward the end of the performance Pink Floyd bassist Guy Pratt joined the band on stage alongwith Rick Wright for a rendition of 'Comfortably Numb'. This was followed by David Gilmour, Gary Wallis, Tim Renwick and Claudia Fontaine along with Guy and Rick, performing a number of edited versions of Floyd songs including 'Money' and 'What Do You Want From Me'. It was an incredible ending to an unbelievable night.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1f359b9007a60c4d2ab1ff31c838a8ccda28735","amp;dn":"Australian+Pink+Floyd+-+2007-05-04+-+Royal+Albert+Hall+in+London","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1f359b9007a60c4d2ab1ff31c838a8ccda28735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,243,89,185,0,122,96,196,210,171,31,243,28,131,138,140,205,162,135,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
