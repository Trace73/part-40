For various reasons, from rights and contractual issues to a wariness to release it in a post-Columbine world, the film and its sequel were never released domestically. It was shown sporadically here and there at a few festivals and released on DVD in Europe and Asia but until now the only way to see it on home video in the United States was to import a legitimate release or snag one of the countless bootleg copies that have been floating around for years (despite no official release the film really hasn't been all that difficult to acquire).
