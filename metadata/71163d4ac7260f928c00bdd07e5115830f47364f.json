Fiction Writer's Workshop, Second Edition, is designed to help you foster a strong sense of independenceÃ¢â‚¬â€of being and thinking on your own, of becoming self-evaluative without being self-criticalÃ¢â‚¬â€in order to accomplish what others seek in classroom groups.\n\nIn this comprehensive guide, award-winning writer and teacher Josip Novakovich explores every aspect of the art of fiction and provides all the tools and techniques you'll need to develop day-to-day discipline as well as a personal writing style, such as:\n\n    More than 100 writing exercises, including dozens that are new to this edition, that challenge you to experiment with diverse writing styles\n    Specific statements of purpose for each exercise, to help guide you and instruct you at every step of the creative process\n    Self-critique questions to help you assess your work and identify strengths and weaknesses before moving on to the next lesson\n    The full text of eight acclaimed short stories, with analysis and exercises, to provide models for your own writing and help reinforce the lessons you've learned\n\nThe practical, insightful methods offered in this workshop will clarify your voice, broaden your perspective, and strengthen your fiction.\n\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nJosip Novakovich (Croatian: NovakoviÃ„â€¡) is a Canadian writer.\n...\n\nHe has published a novel (April Fool's Day), three short story collections (Yolk, Salvation and Other Disasters, Infidelities: Stories of War and Lust), four collections of narrative essays (Apricots from Chernobyl, Plum Brandy: Croatian Journey, Three Deaths, and Shopping for a New Country); and two textbooks (Writing Fiction Step by Step, Fiction Writer's Workshop) and hundreds of short stories and essays.\n\nNovakovich is the recipient of the Whiting Writer's Award, a Guggenheim fellowship, two fellowships from the National Endowment of the Arts, panelist of National Endowment of the Arts, an award from the Ingram Merrill Foundation, and an American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation.
