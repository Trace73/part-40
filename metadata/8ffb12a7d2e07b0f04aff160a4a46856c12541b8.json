Try as I might, I just couldn't find the last couple issues. And that included scanning my own, because I don't have a complete physical run of it, either. So, yesterday, I finally completed a digital version of the series and was able to read the couple issues I'd been missing out on for years.\n\nThe series has an extensive, well-written Wiki page, so I'm not going to say too much. If you want to know more, go here...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangehaven&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangehaven&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI will say that I first discovered this series as a preview in the back of Cerebus 197, and that it's likely one of only handful of comics in the world to give a full-page tribute to issue 300 of that book in its own back pages (issue 16). It was nominated for a small boat load of awards before it went on indefinite hiatus in 2005. Critically lauded, criminally unknown - if you haven't checked this one out yet you should definitely give it a chance.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIssues 1-18 of 'Strangehaven'\n\nAbiogenesis Press, 1995-2005, 32-40 pages each\n\nWritten and Illustrated by Gary Spencer Millidge\n\nAlex Hunter almost runs over a woman while driving through the British countryside, swerving and crashing his car into a tree. He wakes to find himself in the picturesque village of Strangehaven, where a young woman named Janey Jones convinces him to stay. He finds a spacious cottage to rent and a job as a teacher at the local school, but it soon becomes clear that something is awry in Strangehaven. A secretive cult calling themselves The Knights of the Golden Light have taken over all positions of authority, a pagan coven is plotting something out in the woodlands, the woman Alex saw in the road seems to be haunting his dreams, and no matter how far he drives, the village itself will not seem to let him leave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ffb12a7d2e07b0f04aff160a4a46856c12541b8","amp;dn":"Strangehaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ffb12a7d2e07b0f04aff160a4a46856c12541b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,251,18,167,210,224,123,15,4,175,241,96,164,164,104,86,193,37,65,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
