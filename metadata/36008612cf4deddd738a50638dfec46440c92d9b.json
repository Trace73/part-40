Because of this the mkv is sligthly\n       \\&quot;undersized\\&quot;.\n                \n    Why doesn\\'t everything get released as BD5/BD9?\n           \n    -&gt; We don\\'t know and there is no logical reason. However, as time goes on other\n       groups cannot continue to ignore the bluray community by stubbornly releasing\n       incompatible BluRay releases.
