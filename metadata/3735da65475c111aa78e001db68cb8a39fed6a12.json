RUBLU group bring us something new to x264 BluRay rips: an R5 rip (aka RC ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Region C). They took Russian bluray video source and mux it with English audio , in this case line audio. Sure this way you canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get that ultra-mega 5.1 DTS surround as usual from blurays, but at least you have nice video.\n\n\n\n***UPDATE***\nFor those who thinks that this release is a fake, iÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve finally put download links below. And as usual you can expect from any staff member, links are LEGIT &amp; REAL!\n\nPlot: In a world 10 years into the future, vampires make up the vast majority of the population with only 5% of the human race remaining. This presents particular challenges as the vampiresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ food supply ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ human blood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is dwindling and rationing is now the norm. There is growing evidence that vampires deprived of an adequate blood supply are themselves evolving into wild, vile creatures that attack anyone and anything in order to survive. Dr. Edward Dalton, a vampire and hematologist who works for a pharmaceutical firm, has been working on finding an artificial blood supply that will meet the vampire societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s needs. He is sympathetic to humans and sees his work as a way of alleviating their suffering but his views on finding a solution change considerably when he meets someone who found a way to transform himself from being a vampire to again take human form.\n\nGenre: Action | Drama | Horror | Sci-Fi | Thriller\nIMDB rating: 6.8/10 (11,101 votes)\nDirected by: Michael Spierig, Peter Spierig\nStarring: Harriet Minto-Day, Ethan Hawke, Jay LagaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢aia\n\nRelease Name: Daybreakers.2009.RC.LiNE.720p.BluRay.x264-RUBLU\nSize: 4.37 GB\nQuality: 1280ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€544, 6259kbps, 128 kbps MP3\nRuntime: 98 minutes\nFilename: rublu-db720p","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3735da65475c111aa78e001db68cb8a39fed6a12","amp;dn":"Daybreakers.2009.RC.LiNE.720p.BluRay.x264-RUBLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3735da65475c111aa78e001db68cb8a39fed6a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,53,218,101,71,92,17,26,167,142,0,29,182,140,184,163,159,237,106,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
