Hamilton, who mixed together Zoot Sims and Ben Webster to form his own recognizable tone, already sounded in prime form for this set. Teamed up with trumpeter Bill Berry, pianist Nat Pierce, bassist Monty Budwig, and drummer Jake Hanna, Hamilton essentially launched the revival of mainstream jazz with this record. Highlights include &quot;Indiana,&quot; &quot;Stuffy,&quot; &quot;Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Blue Room,&quot; but all eight selections are quite enjoyable.\n\nTrack list:\n01 - That's All\n02 - Indiana\n03 - Stuffy\n04 - Exactly Like You\n05 - Ill Wind\n06 - Broadway\n07 - Blue Room\n08 - Sometimes I'm Happy\n\nEnjoy and share!
