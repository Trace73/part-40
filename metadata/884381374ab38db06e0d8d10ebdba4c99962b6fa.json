Flambay got back to me to say he'd noticed audible clicks every 15 seconds throughout and I/we FREAKED OUT for a while because I'd just seeded the Broadcast version!\n\nWe checked the only 2 copies of the footage in the world and they both had the same problem!\n\nLater that year, PittyLabelle rode to the rescue with a technical solution that didn't require flambay spending the rest of his natural life cleaning the audio up by hand ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Pitty extracted clean copies of the audio and we stopped FREAKING OUT and I got back to the final noodling process of synching it all back together.\n\nEnjoy!! \n\nxxhoff, PittyLabelle &amp; unicrayon\nSeeded: Zappadan 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884381374ab38db06e0d8d10ebdba4c99962b6fa","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+-+Bremen+1968","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884381374ab38db06e0d8d10ebdba4c99962b6fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,67,129,55,74,179,141,176,110,13,141,16,235,219,164,201,153,98,182,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
