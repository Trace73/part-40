Within hours of the EU referendum result, the prime minister had resigned, the pound was falling and Westminster was reeling. So how and why did this political revolution happen - and how does it stand to reshape Britain's politics?\r\n\r\nIn this film, the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg tells the inside story of how David Cameron's referendum plan backfired - and Vote Leave won. Talking to the politicians and the people who ran the campaigns, she finds out how a perfect storm brewed, which would not just end David Cameron's premiership, but reshape Britain's place in the world.\r\n\r\nSource: BBC-HD TS[AVC/AC3] DDD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAVC 1080i &gt; x264 720p (H264 high @L4.1 AVCHD) 2pass approx. 3.3Mbps\r\nAC3 2.0 original stream mux [Dolby Digital]\r\nselectable SRT English CC Subtitles\r\n\r\nSize: 1.46Gb - 1/3 DVD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeff22b6e34b2c9e098571b201841d4bd6ff07d0","amp;dn":"BBC+Brexit+-+The+Battle+for+Britain+CC+HDTV+x264+AC3+2.0+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeff22b6e34b2c9e098571b201841d4bd6ff07d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,255,34,182,227,75,44,158,9,133,113,178,1,132,29,75,214,255,7,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
