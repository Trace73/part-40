We are part of a great soul. A big soul that belongs to all ...\n\nIt is everywhere in the dark. I am where struggle to eat the hungry. It is where the cop beat the helpless. It is where people scream because they are distracted and can not withstand another.\n\nBut I am and where children laugh because they know they are hungry but dinner awaits them. And I will be there when people will eat their own fruits and live in houses they built themselves.\n\nI will be there ... &quot;\n\n&quot;And America, do not you think is so great.
