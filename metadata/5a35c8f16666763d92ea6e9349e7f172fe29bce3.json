B. Damyanov, D. Germanova-Krasteva (MP, 2013).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-60650-387-4\r\n\r\nThis concise guide on statistical quality control in textile processes offers useful guidance to engineers and technicians on how to set up and conduct quality control procedures using the mathematical tools offered in this book. It presents an introduction to the control and optimization of textile processes and the resulting improved quality of manufactured textile products. It offers a review of the methods for experimental design, various textile processes, and the methods for derivation and optimization of mathematical models. Individual models are illustrated with numerical examples, which allow for easier comprehension and implementation of the methods. Special attention is given to the use of Taguchi methods in setting up experimental design models","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a35c8f16666763d92ea6e9349e7f172fe29bce3","amp;dn":"Textile+Processes+-+Quality+Control+and+Design+of+Experiments","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a35c8f16666763d92ea6e9349e7f172fe29bce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,53,200,241,102,102,118,61,146,234,110,147,73,231,241,114,254,41,188,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
