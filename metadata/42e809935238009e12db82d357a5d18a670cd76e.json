Starting as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans.\n Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers; its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on politics and social issues; and its single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e809935238009e12db82d357a5d18a670cd76e","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+%282009-2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e809935238009e12db82d357a5d18a670cd76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,232,9,147,82,56,0,158,18,219,130,211,87,165,209,138,103,12,215,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
