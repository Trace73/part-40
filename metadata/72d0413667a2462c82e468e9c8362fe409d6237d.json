This are his two solo records. This is NOT punk music anymore for those who expects a continuing of the pistols sound. The first record Mercy is mostly made up of love songs with a heavier sound reminding mostly of get a bunch of friends have some drinks and oo yeah i have allot of love songs lets gig a record out. Its easy to listen and not to bad. The second record is more of a normal heavy rock album and does contain some gems actually if you are into heavier music.\n\nThe title song Mercy was also featured in the Miami Vice 2 soundtrack.\n\n\nMercy [1987]\n\nFire And Gasoline (1989)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72d0413667a2462c82e468e9c8362fe409d6237d","amp;dn":"Steve+Jones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72d0413667a2462c82e468e9c8362fe409d6237d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,208,65,54,103,162,70,44,130,228,104,233,200,54,47,228,9,214,35,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
