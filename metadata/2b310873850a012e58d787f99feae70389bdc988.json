Cobb and Mildred Dunnock recreating their original Broadway roles as the Lomans. In a career-defining performance, Cobb portrays the suffering Willy Loman--the middle-aged man at the end of his emotional rope--with Dunnock equally impressive as his patient wife, Linda. George Segal and James Farentino play their disillusioned sons, Biff and Happy.\n\nShattering and unforgettable, this landmark television production has been digitally remastered and will endure for all generations to come. &quot;In a word, superb.&quot; --New York Times.\n\nNot my rip. Note from original poster on Karagarga:\nWhile the production is indeed superb, the visual quality is iffy at best. The image quality is very soft, bright areas are too burnt in, etc. Nevertheless, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never coming back in a better format, so get it while you can.\n\nTrivialists will note not only an early career performance by Gene Wilder, but a rare on-screen appearance (as Jenny) by June Foray aka the voice of Rocky the Flying Squirrel (among many others).\n\n&gt;Death Of A Salesman Act 1.avi\nDVD2DivX/544x416/1.1Mbps/29.97fps/b&amp;w/00:47:42\nmp3/91Mbps/48KHz/Stereo/444MB\n\n&gt;Death Of A Salesman Act 2.avi\nDVD2DivX/544x416/1.1Mbps/29.97fps/b&amp;w/00:47:42\nmp3/91Mbps/48KHz/Stereo/556MB\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b310873850a012e58d787f99feae70389bdc988","amp;dn":"Death+of+a+Salesman+++%281966+-+Lee+J.+Cobb%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b310873850a012e58d787f99feae70389bdc988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,49,8,115,133,10,1,46,88,215,135,249,159,234,231,3,137,189,201,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
