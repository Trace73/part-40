As with other industrial sectors, reducing costs while also reducing environmental impact and improving overall sustainability is becoming an important part of the business process. Providing practical guidance, Energy Efficiency and Management in Food Processing Facilities explores energy efficiency technologies, emerging energy efficient processes, and methods for converting food processing wastes into energy.\r\n\r\nOrganized around five central themes, the book explores:\r\n\r\nFundamentals of energy conservation, analysis, and management\r\nEnergy conservation technologies as applied to the food processing industry\r\nEnergy efficiency and conservations in current food processing systems\r\nEmerging systems\r\nEnergy conversion technologies for utilization of food processing wastes\r\n\r\nConservation Techniques that Improve the Bottom Line\r\n\r\nThe lack of information on energy conservation and conversion technologies has been a major barrier to energy efficiency improvement and the utilization of processing wastes in the food processing industry. With coverage ranging from basic theory to traditional and alternative energy, this book provides the required skill set for the increased energy conservation and reduced consumption that will positively impact the bottom line in food processing facilities","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7c3b96152e70dec94f776f5a470062aea9eeec7","amp;dn":"Energy+Efficiency+and+Management+in+Food+Processing+Facilities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7c3b96152e70dec94f776f5a470062aea9eeec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,195,185,97,82,231,13,236,148,247,118,245,164,112,6,42,234,158,238,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
