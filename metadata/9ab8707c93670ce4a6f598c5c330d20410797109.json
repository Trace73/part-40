For students aspiring to become knowledgeable in process control, this book is designed to be a helpful aid in passing required mathematics courses that are sometimes taught by instructors whose mathematical minds are far above those of their students. Practicing engineers, new to the process control field, will find this book a quick-and-easy review of the mathematics common to the field. In addition to serving as a tutorial or review, chapters on frequency response analysis, transfer functions and block diagrams, and the Z-N approximation will serve as a handy desk reference for any practicing process control engineer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ab8707c93670ce4a6f598c5c330d20410797109","amp;dn":"Basic+Math+for+Process+Control+-+Bob+Connell+%28ISA%2C+2003%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ab8707c93670ce4a6f598c5c330d20410797109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,184,112,124,147,103,12,228,166,245,152,197,195,48,210,4,16,121,113,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
