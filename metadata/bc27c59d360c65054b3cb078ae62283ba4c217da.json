Beth Raymond (Sossamon) is a college student whose friends have all been dying in droves, and the one connecting factor between all of the incidents is that just before their deaths, each of the victims received a message in which they heard themselves being murdered. Upon receiving her own frightening phone call, Beth has only three days to solve the mystery and cheat death. Burns co-stars as a detective who is deeply troubled by the recent spate of deaths. \n\nRipped with Autogk.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 27 Minutes\n\nFile Type: AVI\n\nFrame Width: 688\n\nFrame Height: 384\n\nFrame Rate: 59fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 114kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc27c59d360c65054b3cb078ae62283ba4c217da","amp;dn":"One+Missed+Call%282008%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc27c59d360c65054b3cb078ae62283ba4c217da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,39,197,157,54,12,101,5,75,60,176,120,174,98,40,59,164,194,23,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
