Unfortunately some people encountered some technical problems. So I decided to post ALL THREE TORRENTS again. The music is simply too good to miss even a tiny part. \n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nDutch Treat - Update Artists  - B026,  - B31- - B35\n\nB026 If Only (Dave Matthews)\n\n01 - Pay For What You Get\n02 - Stay (Wasting Time)\n03 - Let You Down\n04 - I'm Alive (&amp; Kenny Chesney)\n05 - If I Had It All\n06 - Sleep To Dream Her\n07 - What You Are\n08 - Gaucho\n09 - Steady As We Go\n10 - Mercy\n11 - You Might Die Trying\n12 - What Would You Say\n13 - Crash Into Me\n14 - Smooth Rider\n15 - Jimi Thing\n16 - Fool To Think\n17 - Help Myself\n18 - Fat Man In The Bathtub\n19 - Lover Lay Down\n20 - If Only\n21 - The Riff\n22 - The Dreaming Tree\n23 - So Right\n24 - Stolen Away On 55th And 3rd\n25 - Dreams Of Our Fathers\n26 - Love Of My Life (&amp; Santana)\n27 - Dancing Nancies\n28 - Grey Street\n29 - #41\n30 - #34\n\nB031 Speak Now (Taylor Swift)\n\n01 - The Best Day\n02 - Tim Mcgraw\n03 - Your Face\n04 - Long Live\n05 - Breathe (&amp; Colbie Caillat)\n06 - Begin Again\n07 - Tied Together With A Smile\n08 - Teardrops On My Guitar\n09 - Love Story\n10 - I Almost Do\n11 - Speak Now\n12 - Mine\n13 - Back To December\n14 - Fifteen\n15 - Never Grow Up\n16 - White Horse\n17 - Stay Beautiful\n18 - You Belong With Me\n19 - Two Is Better Than One (&amp; Boys Like Girls)\n20 - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\n21 - Ronan\n22 - Last Kiss\n23 - Innocent\n24 - Half Of My Heart (&amp; John Mayer)\n\nB032 Lift Me Up (Christina Aguilera)\n\n101 - Save Me From Myself\n102 - Can't Hold Us Down (Ft.
