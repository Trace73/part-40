The album completed the band's transition into a pop group, a genre that yielded the band its greatest success by far, as demonstrated in this album. The album marked the band's Capitol Records debut, and it spent 92 weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200 and became the first and only album of the band's to hit number one. Sales reached quintuple platinum, and the band was officially back in business after a lull in sales. This album also yielded the first number-one single for the band: &quot;These Dreams&quot;. There were also four other hit singles on the album: &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, &quot;What About Love&quot;, &quot;Never&quot;, and &quot;Nothin' at All&quot;. The latter 3 also made the U.S. top ten. \n\n\nStudio album by Heart\n\nReleased\t6 July 1985\nRecorded\tJanuary - April 1985 at The Record Plant, Los Angeles and The Record Plant, Sausalito, CA\nGenre\nHard Rock\n\nLength\t39:11\nLabel\nCapitol Records\n\nProducer\nRon Nevison\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_(band)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_(band)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e86bac3d104877d6fbd510dc62a3c6124eb81e","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Heart+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e86bac3d104877d6fbd510dc62a3c6124eb81e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,232,107,172,61,16,72,119,214,251,213,16,220,98,163,198,18,78,184,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
