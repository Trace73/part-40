Dubbed by its critics &quot;The Berlin Wall of the Middle East&quot; and the &quot;Wall of Apartheid&quot; it is being built at the cost of $1 million per kilometre. The aim, the Israeli government has stated, is to prevent Palestinian &quot;terrorists&quot; from infiltrating into Israel. For many Palestinians however it is nothing more than a sinister ploy to grab more of their land and further reinforce the occupation through the &quot;ghettoisation&quot; of their communities. At the same time many Israelis and Palestinians wonder if it could turn out to be the borderline for a future Palestinian state.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d79ad1e9a2626f41a2f129eea351b5c770f49b8","amp;dn":"Behind+The+Fence+-+Wall+Of+Apartheid+-+Israel+Palestine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d79ad1e9a2626f41a2f129eea351b5c770f49b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,121,173,30,154,38,38,244,26,47,18,158,234,53,27,92,119,15,73,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
