It celebrated the garage rock music of the mid 60&amp;#039;s with future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye providing dead-on liner notes. The band&amp;#039;s featured on the album laid the blueprint for such bands as The New York Dolls, The Stooges and Patti Smith as well as the punk movement. The songs are no nonsense, crazed out rockers with some psychedelia and dance tracks thrown in. Rhino Records has done an amazing job expanding the original double album into a four cd set. Some of the songs like The Kingsmen &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, Sam The Sham &amp; Pharaoh&amp;#039;s &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;, The Outsiders&amp;#039; &quot;Time Wont Let Me&quot;, The Human Beinz propulsive &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, The Musical Explosion&amp;#039;s &quot;Little Bit O&amp;#039; Soul&quot;, The Count Five&amp;#039;s &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;, The Castaways&amp;#039; &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; were all top ten hits with The Strawberry Alarm Clock&amp;#039;s &quot;Incense &amp; Peppermint&quot; going all the way to number one. For the most part, the collection is made up of obscure songs that were minor national hits and regional hits around the country. Songs like The Cryan Shames&amp;#039; searing &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, The Barbarians&amp;#039; earnest &quot;Moulty&quot;, The Lollipop Shoppe&amp;#039;s pulsating &quot;You Must Be A Witch&quot;, The Sonics&amp;#039; &quot;Strychnine&quot;, Kim Fowley&amp;#039;s spooky &quot;The Trip&quot;, Rare Breed&amp;#039;s (who became American Breed and scored a top ten hit with Bend Me, Shape Me) r&amp;b flavored &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal&quot;, Richard &amp; The Young Lions&amp;#039; stellar &quot;Open Up Your Door&quot;, The Bees&amp;#039; buzzing &quot;Voices Green &amp; Purple&quot; and The Palace Guards&amp;#039; bubble gummy &quot;Falling Sugar&quot; are all basically unknowns. But they all show an immense amount of heart and soul and the classic three chords and a dream philosophy of most bands out there. Some well known bands show up with some lesser known hits like The Turtles, Captain Beefheart and Paul Revere &amp; The Raiders whose &quot;Just Like Me&quot; is an absolute rave-up. Some famous artists appear in their first or lesser known groups like Todd Rundgren with The Nazz on &quot;Open Our Eyes, Ted Nugent on two songs from The Amboy Dukes, ZZ Top&amp;#039;s Billy Gibbons with The 13th Floor Elevators and Creedence Clearwater Revival shows up under their original moniker, The Golliwogs, with the chooglin &quot;Fight Fire&quot;. Other great songs include some semi-famous tracks like the frat rock classics &quot;Double Shot (Of My Baby&amp;#039;s Love&quot; by The Swinging Medallions and The Premiers &quot;Farmer John&quot;, The Standells&amp;#039; &quot;Dirty Water&quot;, The Strangeloves &quot;I Want Candy&quot; which Bow Wow Wow would turn into a new wave staple, Love&amp;#039;s influential &quot;7 And 7 Is&quot; and the Tex-ex stylings of The Hombres&amp;#039; &quot;Let It Out (Let It All Hang Out)&quot;. Nuggets is an essential collection for any fan of rock to have in their collection.\n\n\nPainstakingly remastered from the (mostly mono) original single mixes for best-ever sound\n\nStay tune for the other 3 disc\n\n\nTrack Listings Disc 1\n\n1.
