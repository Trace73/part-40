Orchestrated by Norman Granz to come as close to an authentic jam session as possible, this is the first of the Jazz at the Philharmonic series. The album includes an original blues tune (&quot;Jam Blues&quot;), a medley of ballads selected by each musician, and a mellow blues tune called &quot;Funky Blues.&quot;\n\nThe standard &quot;What is This Thing Called Love,&quot; stands out particularly for its follow-the-leader style ending, with each musician trading fours. Interestingly, the meeting of these three greats, with their widely varying styles, results not in spectacular and fiercely competitive playing, but rather in a slight muting and sense of reserve from all three.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1 \tJam Blues \t14:33\n2 \tWhat Is This Thing Called Love \t15:49\n3  \tBallad Medley (17:13)\n 3.1 \t\tAll The Things You Are \t\n 3.2 \t\tDearly Beloved \t\n 3.3 \t\tThe Nearness Of You \t\n 3.4 \t\tI'll Get By (As Long As I Have You) \t\n 3.5 \t\tEverything Happens To Me \t\n 3.6 \t\tThe Man I Love \t\n 3.7 \t\tWhat's New? \t\n 3.8 \t\tSomeone To Watch Over Me \t\n 3.9 \t\tIsn't It Romantic \t\n  \t-\n4 \tFunky Blues \t2:14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:645e02a31f86819ab52c0cd53d144c9cdcfd547d","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+-+Jam+session","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"645e02a31f86819ab52c0cd53d144c9cdcfd547d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,94,2,163,31,134,129,154,181,44,12,213,61,20,76,156,220,253,84,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
