Around the globe, China is also doing whatever it takes to capture crucial resourcesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½even if it means promoting nuclear proliferation by the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most dangerous regimes. Inside the United States, Americans are being injured or killed by the DragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dangerous exports: poisoned food, spiked drugs, toxic toys. Meanwhile, huge U.S. corporations have allied with ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s state-owned enterprises to destroy American manufacturingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, ultimately and ironically, destroy themselves. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an incredible and incredibly shameful story, and Death by China tells it all. But understanding the reality of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s assault on America is only the beginning. Leading economists Peter Navarro and Greg Autry offer a complete plan for surviving the global power shift China has already engineeredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and halting the DragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s onslaught before itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too late. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not China ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbashingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ if itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s true\n\nChallenging the China apologists and appeasers\n\nThe DragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death to AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s manufacturing base\nHow ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s totalitarianism, mercantilism, and protectionism are winning\n\nChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdark visitorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ steal the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ to hang us with\n\nBeijingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Red Hacker Brigades vow: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe will bury you, Chinese-styleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nDeath by Colonial DragonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½A rising hegemonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revenge\nVacuuming up AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s resources, plundering Latin America, bullying Asia\n\n300 pages \nPublisher: Pearson Prentice Hall; 1 edition (May 15, 2011) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b344ba7189ad7aea8c11c1f762910d8fc02b75a","amp;dn":"Death+By+China+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b344ba7189ad7aea8c11c1f762910d8fc02b75a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,52,75,167,24,154,215,174,168,193,28,31,118,41,16,216,252,2,183,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
