Founded in 2004 in Landshut / Germany, Noneuclid combine the instrumental virtuosity and relentless energy of extreme metal with chamber-music like polyphony, high compositional ambition, and the explicit will to innovation. The name refers to dimensions outside conventional reality as defined by Euclid, and NoneuclidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music strives to open doors to unknown psychic spaces.\n\nSince their debut Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Crawling ChaosÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Merciless Records), the band has vigorously pursued their evolution; influences from different metal styles (progressive, death, thrash, black, doom) merge seamlessly with elements from classical, experimental and world music.\nNevertheless, the focus lies always on musicality and cohesiveness, never on experiment or complexity for its own sake. Every song is its own world, obeying its own laws; the band seeks to think outside the box while being firmly rooted in extreme metal at all times.\nThis pioneering spirit led to an appearance in the renowned contemporary music festivals Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dag in de BrandingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Den Haag) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dutch Music DaysÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Amsterdam), where the band premiered the 25-minute death metal symphony Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Vortex CathedralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as soloists along with the world famous Dutch Metropole Orchestra, in front of a stunned classical audience in the fall of 2008.\n\n \n\nIn 2010, the band realized Transition Metal, another ambtious orchestral project in Bavaria, together with the Bavarian Chamber Orchestra, in which the music of Noneuclid and Richard Wagner met and merged in an unprecedented encounter of genres. The orchestral version of Into The Light from this collaboration toured Germany and Holland in 2013 in 8 spectacular shows in the hull of a transformed freight ship travelling along the Rhine.\nThe band amicably parted ways with singer Bruce in late 2010. They continue as a 4-piece with Morean taking over all vocal duties as well. Well I guess that tells you whats up with this band so get it...........\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01085d8dad92e6285948c09cbb4b921459c11062","amp;dn":"Noneuclid+-+Metatheosis++320k++mp3+++++ak2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01085d8dad92e6285948c09cbb4b921459c11062","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,8,93,141,173,146,230,40,89,72,192,156,187,75,146,20,89,193,16,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
