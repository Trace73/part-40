After a while I finally got fed up and just downloaded each individual episodes from various torrents and websites and figured I would post a torrent with them all together?\nThey were also all out of ode and some of them were labeled wrong so it was vary confusing. I just relabeled them according the the episode number and guide I read from wikipedia so hopefully they're all correct.\n\nSo thanks to the people who gave me the individual episodes as I couldn't have gotten them without them.\n\nThe files vary from .avi,.mkv, and .mp4.\nThey're all decent quality I think, I haven't actually watched them yet I just skimmed them to check if they were okay. They're definitely watchable in my opinion. So I hope you guys like the torrent... ;^;\n\nEnjoy\n\n---------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\nEpisode Guide:(pasted from Wikipedia)\n\n1 \t&quot;Battle for Motorcity&quot;\n\nKane tries to cripple Motorcity and when his attack on the Eastside gate fails...he lures the Burners into a trap to destroy Motorcity.\n---------------------\n2 \t&quot;Power Trip&quot;\n\nWhen the Burners get a distress call from Kane Co., they rescue a scientist who was forced into building a power cell strong enough destroy Motorcity. \n---------------------\n3 \t&quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; \n\nKane uses a climator to cause a huge blizzard in Motorcity, and Mike goes missing.
