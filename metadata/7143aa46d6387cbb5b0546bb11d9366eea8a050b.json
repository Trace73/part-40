Born during the Tet Offensive and part of the amnesty for Amerasian children of the late 1970s, Dang Nghiem arrived in this country virtually penniless and with no home. She lived with three foster families, graduated high school with honors, earned two undergraduate degrees, and became a doctor. When the man she thought sheâ€™d spend her life with suddenly drowned, Sister Dang Nghiem left medicine and joined the monastic community of Thich Nhat Hanh.\r\n\r\nIt is from this vantage point that Dang Nghiem writes about her journey of healing. Devastated by the diagnosis and symptoms of Lyme Disease, she realized that she was also reliving many of the unresolved traumas from earlier in her life. She applied both her medical knowledge and her advanced understanding and practice of mindfulness to healing. Through meditation she finally came to understand what it means to â€œmasterâ€ suffering.\r\n\r\nIn Mindfulness as Medicine Sister Dang Nghiem leads readers through her profound journey of healing and shares step-by-step directions for the techniques she used to transform her suffering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7143aa46d6387cbb5b0546bb11d9366eea8a050b","amp;dn":"Mindfulness+as+Medicine+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7143aa46d6387cbb5b0546bb11d9366eea8a050b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,67,170,70,214,56,124,187,91,5,70,187,17,217,54,110,234,138,5,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
