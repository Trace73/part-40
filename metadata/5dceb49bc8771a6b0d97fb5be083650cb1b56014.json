For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. (1 Peter 2:12, 15)\n\nHypocrites! Hateful! Greedy! The accusations will come. The key is to silence our critics, not by taking a defensive stand, even though that worked for Elijah, but by exhibiting good behavior with which the accusers cannot argue.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dceb49bc8771a6b0d97fb5be083650cb1b56014","amp;dn":"Heretical+accusations+against+Christians","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dceb49bc8771a6b0d97fb5be083650cb1b56014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,206,180,155,200,119,26,107,13,151,251,91,224,131,101,12,177,181,96,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
