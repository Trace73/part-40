As with the beginnings of all new music, early Bluegrass was fraught with animosity between rivals and former colleagues, incestuous relationships between the personnel of the first bands and professional jealousy, but these three CDs contain arguably the greatest examples of this newly-minted music from its greatest purveyors.
