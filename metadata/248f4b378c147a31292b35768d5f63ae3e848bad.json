It would be a good movie to use to supplement classes in school studying history or political science. The people interviewed are well-respected in their fields. I find it amazing that so many well-known people agreed to be interviewed. The importance of what they said is timely and should be seen by anyone who is concerned about US foreign policy and the future of our republic. I found the information disturbing, but as Americans we need to be aware of our own history and find the courage to change. While there are dark truths told through this film, these are balanced by the glimmers of hope from people who tried to make a difference as an inspiration to future generations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:248f4b378c147a31292b35768d5f63ae3e848bad","amp;dn":"Superpower+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"248f4b378c147a31292b35768d5f63ae3e848bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,143,75,55,140,20,122,49,41,43,53,118,141,95,99,174,62,132,139,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
