Beyond the basics, coverage includes recent developments in innate and adaptive immunological mechanisms involved in the host response to fungal infection. The volumeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s topical sections provide an immunological perspective on the cells, soluble factors and receptors involved in recognising and combating fungal infections. Discussion includes descriptions of immunity to specific pathogens, immune-escape mechanisms used by fungi, and therapeutic strategies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c632ef47150f0aaea81f7cd5746a14d4428200a0","amp;dn":"Immunology+of+Fungal+Infections+%7BNil%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c632ef47150f0aaea81f7cd5746a14d4428200a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,50,239,71,21,15,10,174,168,31,124,213,116,106,20,212,66,130,0,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
