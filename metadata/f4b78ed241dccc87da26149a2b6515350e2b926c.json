Rasul Siddik and\nItaru Oki play trumpet and flugelhorn, Didier Lasserre and Makoto Sato play the\ndrums. Duboc's philosophy is that music has no center anymore, it is created by\nthe context of players, of the moment, of the creative inspiration. And that's\nhow the music sounds: shifting phrases, floating on an evolution of ideas and\ninspirations of the moment, moving forward, yet without a clear path but still\nfocused. The first part is close to twenty-five minutes long, the second\nfourty-three minutes, and they were recorded live at Le CarrÃƒÂ© Bleu, in\nPoitiers, France on February 5, 2009. And what you here is music flowing, with\nvariations in the levels of intensity, without rhythms or melodies, yet utterly\nmusical and lyrical. There is nothing harsh, abrasive or violent, just this\ninteresting development of creative interaction. The band is one of the best\ndevelopments in the musical lineage that was started by the AACM, but the title\nsuggests other sources as well : Don Cherry's &quot;Symphony For Improvisers&quot;, &quot;Old\n&amp; New Dreams&quot;, and &quot;OtherDimensions In Music&quot;. All among my favorite albums and\nbands. Creative beauty, sensitive lyricism, controlled freedom, respectful\ndissonance, and moments of magical expressivity. Let's give them a five star\nrating again.\n\n--\n\nby John Sharpe &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34980&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=34980&lt;/a&gt;\n\nby Paul Serralheiro &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1084&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.squidsear.com/cgi-bin/news/newsView.cgi?newsID=1084&lt;/a&gt;\n\nper Pierre Lemarchand (fr) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2010/08/28/18891583.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://grisli.canalblog.com/archives/2010/08/28/18891583.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4b78ed241dccc87da26149a2b6515350e2b926c","amp;dn":"Nuts+-+Symphony+for+Old+and+New+Dimensions+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4b78ed241dccc87da26149a2b6515350e2b926c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,183,142,210,65,220,204,135,218,38,20,154,43,101,21,53,14,43,146,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
