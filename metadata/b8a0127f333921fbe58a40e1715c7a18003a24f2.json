He examines extraordinary personalities such as Caligula and Nero and seismic events such as the conquest of Britain and the establishment of a 'New Rome' at Constantinople and the split into eastern and western empires. Along the way we encounter gladiators and charioteers, senators and slaves, fascinating women, bizarre sexual practices and grotesque acts of brutality, often seen through eyes of some of the world's greatest writers. He concludes with a brief look at how Rome lives on in the contemporary world, in politics, architecture, art and literature.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8a0127f333921fbe58a40e1715c7a18003a24f2","amp;dn":"The+Rise+%26amp%3B+Fall+of+the+Roman+Empire++%282013+-+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8a0127f333921fbe58a40e1715c7a18003a24f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,160,18,127,51,57,33,251,229,138,64,225,113,92,122,24,0,58,36,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
