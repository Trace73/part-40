Here he presents their valuable advice on what really matters in life, and how to put this cumulative wisdom into practice. The interviewees, ranging from aboriginal elders to town barbers, from Holocaust survivors to former CEO's, reflects back on their lives to identify the sources of happiness and meaning as well as lessons learned, regrets, and major crossroads. Baced on these interviews, and Dr. Izzo's twenty years experience helping people find more spirit and purpose, the book explores the secrets to finding contentment and happiness.\n\nPlaying time: 5 hours\n\nProduced in 2008 by BBC Audiobooks\n\n128 kbps\n44 kHz\nStereo\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dcac0205ed2f26991fe08422c9f93640b1dca2a","amp;dn":"John+Izzo-The+Five+Secrets+You+Must+Discover+Before+You+Die","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dcac0205ed2f26991fe08422c9f93640b1dca2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,202,192,32,94,210,242,105,145,254,8,66,44,159,147,100,11,29,202,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
