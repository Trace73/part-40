In every lonely corner of every sea, through every night, every day, and every imaginable weather, tiny crews of seafarers work the giant ships which keep landed life afloat. These ordinary men live extraordinary lives, subject to dangers and difficulties we can only imagine, from hurricanes and pirates to years of confinement in hazardous, if not hellish, environments. Horatio Clare joins two container ships on their epic voyages across the globe and experiences unforgettable journeys. As the ships cross seas of history and incident, seafarers unfold the stories of their lives, and a beautiful and terrifying portrait of the oceans and their human subjects emerges.\r\n\r\n'Tremendous' *The Times*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8522ce8550ba580ff9a08b56257600132705798c","amp;dn":"Down+To+The+Sea+in+Ships+-+Horatio+Clare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8522ce8550ba580ff9a08b56257600132705798c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,34,206,133,80,186,88,15,249,160,139,86,37,118,0,19,39,5,121,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
