This book culminates almost sixty years of the scientist's research of the origin and classification of the flowering plants. It presents a continuation of Dr. TakhtajanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s earlier publications including &quot;Systema Magnoliophytorum&quot; (1987), (in Russian), and &quot;Diversity and Classification of Flowering Plants&quot; (1997), (in English). In his latest book, the author presents a concise and significantly revised system of plant classification (`Takhtajan system') based on the most recent studies in plant morphology, embryology, phytochemistry, cytology, molecular biology and palynology. Flowering plants are divided into two classes: class Magnoliopsida (or Dicotyledons) includes 8 subclasses, 126 orders, c. 440 families, almost 10,500 genera, and no less than 195,000 species; and class Liliopsida (or Monocotyledons) includes 4 subclasses, 31 orders, 120 families, more than 3,000 genera, and about 65,000 species.This book contains a detailed description of plant orders, and descriptive keys to plant families providing characteristic features of the families and their differences.\n\n\n906 Pages\n\n2009","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa5959f4c1dafed97d3da3d98c7c07af5e72a74","amp;dn":"Flowering+Plants+2nd+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa5959f4c1dafed97d3da3d98c7c07af5e72a74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,165,149,159,76,29,175,237,151,211,218,61,152,199,192,122,245,231,42,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
