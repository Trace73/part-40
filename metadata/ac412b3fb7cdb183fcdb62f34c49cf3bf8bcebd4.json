Take a listen and if you dig it, buy a copy and help Mike out! This one\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s a keeper for sure...check out the review, enjoy, comment and above all, SEED!!!!!\n\nWndrngpoet\n\nFrom allmusic.com:\n\nPrior to the release of his fourth studio album, ex-Soul Coughing frontman Mike Doughty sent out a press release that highlighted some key points concerning Yes and Also Yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' creation. The tone of the 11-point list, which leaned toward the comedic, but with DoughtyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s signature dark wit, dutifully reflected the timbre of Yes and Also Yes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' 14 tracks, a solid collection of smart, sardonic, occasionally sweet gems that play out like a career overview. Opening cut and single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNa Na Nothing,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which was supposedly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpartially stolen from a song written by Nikki Sixx, Dan Wilson, and Matt Gerrard,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is built off of a clean, winning hook set atop a bed of acoustic guitars and propelled by a thick backbeat that leans hard on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\'90s alt-pop. Four of the cuts, the sparse ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRussell,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the punk-infused ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHave at It,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the German-language rave-up ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMakelloser Mann,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the vivid ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTelegenic Exes, #1 (Hapless Dancers)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ clock in at under two minutes, but Doughty, who ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œused a capsule of the antidepressant duloxetine as a percussion instrument on some tracks,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ infuses real emotion into each, which renders their brevity poignant. Elsewhere, the loose and likeable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDay by Day ByÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ echoes Soul Coughing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s winning marriage of deep grooves and beat poetry, the lovely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHoliday (What Do You Want?),ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ co-written by Dan Wilson and featuring a nice, raw, duet-style harmony from Rosanne Cash, feels like the less intoxicated, younger sibling of the Pogues\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFairytale of New York,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the Smashmouth-esque ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeird SummerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVegetable,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ like nearly everything on this typically fine set of work, sound like future fan favorites and live staples.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac412b3fb7cdb183fcdb62f34c49cf3bf8bcebd4","amp;dn":"Mike+Doughty+-+Yes+And+Also+Yes+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac412b3fb7cdb183fcdb62f34c49cf3bf8bcebd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,65,43,63,183,205,177,131,252,219,98,243,76,73,207,59,248,188,235,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
