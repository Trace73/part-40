Her tones still have a whispering undertow to them.\nShe has been around for a while: this is her fifth album as a solo artist, and she has also recorded and performed with the Irish-American collective, Cherish the Ladies. Talbot is a schooled singer, and also a capable ukulele player.\nBut the title Angels Without Wings seems curiously inappropriate for an album that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much of the gritty or the earthbound in it.\nWhile the lyrics usually tell of lost or rickety love, TalbotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mesmerizing voice and John McCuskerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s velvety production often, perhaps unconsciously, smoothes out the messy feelings she explores.\nAt points thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a distance to this album, a mannered approach, and the songsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ emotional hearts often feel bypassed. But on the song that she does riddle with feeling, Dearest Johnny, Talbot is majestic.\nShe retains a tinkling precision here, but the overall sound is freer, aptly reflecting the traditional origins of the song. Buoyed by banjo, fiddle and accordion, her voice transmits both anguish and pride, beautifully inhabiting her character.\nThe other problem with Angels Without Wings is guest overdose. Although the Mark Knopfler and Boo Hewerdine guitar support is a good fit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ particularly HewerdineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sensitive work on My Sister The Moon, a track he also penned Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the vocal spots are less consistent.\nOn Button Up, the Scottish cadence of King Creosote chimes well, but on Wine and Roses Tim OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Brien seems shoehorned in. This happens repeatedly: Talbot is getting on very well with a song and the introduction of a new voice halfway through breaks the mood.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s particularly inappropriate on the break-up track IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not Sorry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a solo lyrical theme if ever there was one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when Guy Fletcher pipes up.\nAngels Without Wings is as downy as TalbotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a compliment Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nor, in fact, is it an insult. For while some of this album is beautiful and delicate, at other times its vocal and musical honey smothers the intimacy of the lyrics.\nTalbot could have buried a few more stingers in the nectar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f397f20460f21132dcc188e5d62b1fd8d0a372cd","amp;dn":"Heidi+Talbot+-+Angels+Without+Wings+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f397f20460f21132dcc188e5d62b1fd8d0a372cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,151,242,4,96,242,17,50,220,193,136,229,214,43,31,216,208,163,114,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
