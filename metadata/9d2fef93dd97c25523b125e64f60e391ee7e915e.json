It is an unsettling story about identity, consciousness, and what it means to be human.\n\nThe radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people. Underwater facility PATHOS-II has suffered an intolerable isolation and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to have to make some tough decisions. What can be done? What makes sense? What is left to fight for?\n\nEnter the world of SOMA and face horrors buried deep beneath the ocean waves. Delve through locked terminals and secret documents to uncover the truth behind the chaos. Seek out the last remaining inhabitants and take part in the events that will ultimately shape the fate of the station. But be careful, danger lurks in every corner: corrupted humans, twisted creatures, insane robots, and even an inscrutable omnipresent A.I.\nYou will need to figure out how to deal with each one of them. Just remember thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no fighting back, either you outsmart your enemies or you get ready to run.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nMINIMUM: \nOS: 64-bit Windows 7 \nProcessor: Core i3 / AMD A6 2.4Ghz \nMemory: 4 GB RAM \nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GT 240 / AMD Radeon HD 4670. \nHard Drive: 25 GB available space \nAdditional Notes: Integrated Intel graphics are not supported.
