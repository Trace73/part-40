Much of the charm of the film lies in the recognition of man's ability of making a complete fool of himself. The natural beauty of the leading character, Sibylla, her disarming honesty in her doomed love for an older man makes one wonder at the forced and unnaturally contrived lives we all lead. Never preachy or heavy-handed, sentimental nor crude, but always utterly believable, its straightforwardness is deceiving. The village in which most of the action takes place is filled with its fair share of funnily sketched characters. Entertaining as they are, they only serve as distractions from what lies beneath.\nThe clever and convincing script, the sober but beautiful photography and the natural performances combined with the assured direction make this German/Georgian co-production a little gem of which any big name director would have been proud. I'm happy to say they still make them this way.\n\n\nVideo\nCodec--XVID\nLength--1:31:34 (164,640frms)\nResolution--560 x 320\nDar-1.750 (7:4)\nFPS--29.970\nBitrate--932kbps\nQF--0.174\n\nAudio--0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3 (48000Hz  128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1642427.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1642427.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643221.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643221.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643508.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643508.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643916.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1643916.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1644266-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1644266-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1644673-1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i585.photobucket.com/albums/ss292/theoneleggedrooster/vlcsnap-1644673-1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
