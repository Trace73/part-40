Glam Knits shows readers how to incorporate those specialty yarns into their garments and accessories with a high-fashion persona that only Stefanie Japel can capture. Sophisticated evening wear pieces like camisoles, dresses, skirts, blouses and more are silhouetted straight from the runway without being overly trendy or easily dated. Stefanie's patterns feature a wide variety of knitting techniques including top-down construction, set-in sleeves, side-to-side knitting, hand stitching, beaded knitting, and more. Readers will appreciate the lavish photography and the wearable nature of the patterns.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06e02b51e3512954c87aeec9dc0d6560ddcf2ecc","amp;dn":"Glam+Knits%3A+25+Designs+for+Luxe+Yarns","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06e02b51e3512954c87aeec9dc0d6560ddcf2ecc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,224,43,81,227,81,41,84,200,122,238,201,220,13,101,96,221,207,46,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
