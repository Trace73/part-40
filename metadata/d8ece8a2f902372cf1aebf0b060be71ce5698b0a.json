Well, not in this 24 minute sketch anyway...\n\nIt wouldn't be until a few years later when they did \n3 more specials, bringing Audrey Meadows back to replace \nthe Alice Kramden (Sheila) who previously replaced her!\n\nThe minuses: \n\nThe other non-Honeymooners material was edited out \nof this special. Whatever it was surely included Gleason's monolog, \nThe June Taylor Dancers, and most likely a sketch with actor \nGary Merrill (whose name appears in the opening credits). The end \ncredits reveal there was a bit called &quot;Back in the Twenties and Thirties&quot;.
