The series is designed to equip meth users, their families, and the professionals who assist them with a solid understanding of the biological basis of addiction, effective tools for recovery, and, most importantly, hope for the future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4b7c9ce6f63c6812caee05eaaaa776cedb09eb0","amp;dn":"Meth+Inside-Out","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4b7c9ce6f63c6812caee05eaaaa776cedb09eb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,183,201,206,111,99,198,129,44,174,224,94,170,170,119,108,237,176,158,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
