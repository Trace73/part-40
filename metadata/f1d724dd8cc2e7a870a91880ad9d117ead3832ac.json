The torrent collects Copra Compendium Volume 1 (Issues #1-3), Copra Compendium Volume 2 (Issues #4-6), and individual issues #7-11. All that's missing from the first major arc is issue 12, which I think has been released but I could not find it. Otherwise, it's everything you need to get started! Check out any review or the author's website for more info, but I doubt you'll be disappointed. Enjoy and please seed! :-) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1d724dd8cc2e7a870a91880ad9d117ead3832ac","amp;dn":"Copra+%28Compendium+V1+%2B+V2%2C+Issues+07-11%2C+2013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1d724dd8cc2e7a870a91880ad9d117ead3832ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,215,36,221,140,194,231,168,112,169,24,128,173,157,17,126,173,56,50,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
