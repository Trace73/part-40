Troy, however, is an alien from the planet Anterias. As a benefit of her half-alien parentage, Evie develops three powers as the series progresses. She can pause and un-pause time, &quot;gleep&quot; objects into existence, and can transport herself from one place to another. Troy is living on Anterias and is never seen, but Evie talks to him via a crystal cube. Evie is thirteen at the beginning of the series and lives with her mother in Marlowe, California. Visitors to the Garland home include Donna&amp;#039;s brother Beano; the mayor Kyle Applegate, a former actor; Lindsey, Evie&amp;#039;s best friend; Chris, Evie&amp;#039;s boyfriend; and Buzz, who tends to take things literally. Episodes usually revolve around Evie getting herself out of a situation that she has caused.  Written by John T.
