The Beatles were the first band I got into, and I've been a fan for 15 years or so, since I was a kid.  I was in Section E, Row 17, seat 3, right by the aile.  I had a great view, and I think the recording came out pretty good.  This is one of better recordings (if that means anything).  The acoustic songs are a big quiet, and there's some minor yelling/clapping, but my &quot;neighbors&quot; were mostly quiet throughout the show.  I hope Paul does more US touring next year, I would love to see him again.  It was hot and nasty in Milwaukee and Paul was sweating a lot, his voice had some rough spots, but, whatever, great show.  \n\nTracklist\n\n01. Eight Days A Week\n02. Junior's Farm\n03.
