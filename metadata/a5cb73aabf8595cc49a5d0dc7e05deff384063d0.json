Shining Stranger \n11. The Honest Song\n\nThe BBC Radio 2 Young Folk Award Winner Megan Henwood has released her aptly named debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœMaking WavesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. An offering of allusive self-penned songs whose musical arrangements mirror an emotional journey of strength, strife, hope, love and despair. She demonstrates a mature view of contemporary society unafraid to question socal issues and motives. A spectacular debut!\n\nMaking Waves, the title track, is a great political cry to stop complaining, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœget off your arseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, take some action and make waves. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great to see such a young singer making a bold and gutsy statement, this track alone has potential to be a collective anthem.\n\nHer songs have a maturity which have been influenced by her own personal journeys. At 18 she paid her way through Venice, Thailand, India and Malaysia as a young troubadour playing her guitar and singing her songs. This made a lasting impression which has since led her back to the people of Nepal to record with leading Nepalese musicians Nirmal Kulu, Binod Katal and Shyram Saram Nepali.\n\nHer songwriting is comparable to Karina Polwart, clever and scarily accurate in social observation, often touching upon aspects of life that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather hide away and deny a responsibility for. Happy Healthy Boy contrasts the lives of two happy healthy men who have fallen to the depths of despair. The angst is mirrored in the music which rises to a crescendo and energetic cry of Ã¢â‚¬Å“they cry and they weep, I sadly doubt they will ever smile again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Although the song narrates the decline of the lives of two men, you are left with the question about societyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsibility for them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5cb73aabf8595cc49a5d0dc7e05deff384063d0","amp;dn":"Megan+Henwood+-+Making+Waves+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5cb73aabf8595cc49a5d0dc7e05deff384063d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,203,115,170,191,133,149,204,73,165,208,220,126,5,222,255,56,64,99,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
