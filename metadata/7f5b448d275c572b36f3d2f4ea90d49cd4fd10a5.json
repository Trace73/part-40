The thunderous ones are delivered with jaw-dropping bravura and the tender ones are delivered with great emotional depth coming from his very soul. You won't believe Alexis' technique.\n\nMany pianist have complained that Rachmaninov's piano works are almost unplayable due to the fact they were written for Rachmaninov himself whose hands were physically enormous. I can remember many years ago an interview with a world famous pianist that had just recorded the Preludes and he was almost in tears recounting the demands of the works he had just recorded. Well, from listening to Weissenberg's recording, I don't think he shed any tears over the demands of the works. His playing is truly exciting in every way.\n\nIf you want to hear the Rachmaninov Preludes played as no one else can play them, download this torrent!\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f5b448d275c572b36f3d2f4ea90d49cd4fd10a5","amp;dn":"Rachmaninov+-+The+Preludes+-+Weissenberg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f5b448d275c572b36f3d2f4ea90d49cd4fd10a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,91,68,141,39,92,87,43,54,243,210,244,234,144,212,156,212,253,16,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
