Beginning with Allende's 1970 election, Soto painstakingly documents the conspiracy to end Chile's social reforms with a military coup headed by General Augusto Pinochet. It's hardly subtle: The pure-of-heart Marxist activists, idealistic students, and salt-of-earth working-class peasants heroically stand up to a conspiracy of corrupt businessmen, fascist military officers, and the American CIA in a fight that, we know from history, dooms them to martyrdom. Soto's tangled narrative timeline jumps back and forth without warning, a confusing design to say the least, and his portraits of the heroes and villains are little better than agitprop. Then again, this is less a history lesson than a political statement, and he pulls no punches in his damning accusations, from the greed of multinationals and American interests to the vicious executions of leftists, intellectuals, and artists in the wake of the coup. It's a gripping true story that will have most viewers just as angry by the final frames. As the ailing Pinochet tries to sidestep responsibility of human-rights violations under his rule, the film couldn't be more timely. The title, by the way, is a code used by the leftist defenders. --Sean Axmaker\n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAkAkaADE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/jAkAkaADE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nRip specs:\n\nFile Name ..........: It's Raining On Santiago.AC3-MrD.avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 1.469.407.232 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 1.434.968 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1.401,34 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 1.306.629.016 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 1.276.005 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 1.246,10 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:53:02\nVideo Codec Code ...: DIV3\nVideo Codec Name ...: Low motion DivX MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1541 KB/s\nResolution .........: 640 x 384\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.66:1\nTotal Frames .......: 162596 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 23,976 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 24 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,261 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: No\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 162.768.000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 158.953 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 155,23 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:53:02\nAudio Codec Code ...: 8192 (0x2000)\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 1 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4ded2f8043485d22b89b0eaadc0acb4a68bd68","amp;dn":"Helvio+Soto+-+Rain+Over+Santiago+%281976%29+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4ded2f8043485d22b89b0eaadc0acb4a68bd68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,77,237,47,128,67,72,93,34,184,155,14,170,220,10,203,74,104,189,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
