As a songwriter, Ackles was among the darkest princes of his time, though the lyrics were delivered with a subdued resignation that kept them from crossing the line to hysterical gloom. &quot;The Road to Cairo,&quot; covered by Julie Driscoll, Brian Auger, and the Trinity, is probably the most famous song here. But the others are quality efforts as well, whether the epics tell of religious trial, as in &quot;His Name Is Andrew,&quot; or the mini-horror tale of revisiting an old home in &quot;Sonny Come Home.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
