Catherine is lost in a mid-level magazine job and marriage to a man she felt was her last chance at love. Unfulfilled but now resigned to her life as a wife and working mother, she begs for a travel assignment to Rio that takes her away from it all - even if for a few days. It's at a fabulous rooftop pool overlooking Ipanema Beach that she meets David, a consummate bachelor and venture capitalist with impeccable breeding punctuated by an Essex accent. In the passing of a day, David shows Catherine more of life than she's lived in years. Lost in the crashing waves of an afternoon thunderstorm in Rio, a single kiss leads to a series of unforgettable liaisons tracking lions in the wild African bush, swimming in the warm volcanic waters off Italy's Aeolian Islands and discovering the secret hallways of the Ritz Paris as each meeting reveals David to be so much more than she ever expected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92276733772e83b090d7e5ca545c203027112620","amp;dn":"Lost+in+Hotels+by+M.+Martin+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92276733772e83b090d7e5ca545c203027112620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,39,103,51,119,46,131,176,144,215,229,202,84,92,32,48,39,17,38,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
