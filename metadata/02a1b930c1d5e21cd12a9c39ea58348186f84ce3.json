He was abandoned at birth near the Asahi orphanage. Because of that event, Yuki strives for independence. He hates being a burden to anyone near him, but at the same time, he is afraid of being left alone. Moreover, ever since he can remember, he has had a strange ability that when he touches others, he can feel their emotion. Unable to control it, he's often made insensitive blunders in the past. He later meets a mysterious yet beautiful stranger who saves his life, but for some reason he feels like he's met before. While death looms and his ability gets stronger and stronger, a man who claims to be his older brother suddenly appears.
