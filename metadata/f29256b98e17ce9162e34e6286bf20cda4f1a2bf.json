Our goal is to help you reclaim yesterday, enjoy today, and master tomorrow with new ways of seeing and working with your past, present, and future.\r\n\r\nJust as Howard Gardnerâ€™s Multiple Intelligences permanently altered our understanding of intelligence and Malcolm Gladwellâ€™s Blink gave us an appreciation for the adaptive unconscious, Philip Zimbardo and John Boydâ€™s new book changes the way we think about and experience time. It will give you new insights into how family conflicts can be resolved by ways to enhance your sexuality and sensuality, and mindsets for becoming more successful in business and happier in your life. Based on the latest psychological research, The Time Paradox is both a &quot;big think&quot; guide for living in the twenty-first century and one of those rare self-help books that really does have the power to improve lives","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29256b98e17ce9162e34e6286bf20cda4f1a2bf","amp;dn":"The+Time+Paradox+%282009%29+Zimbardo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29256b98e17ce9162e34e6286bf20cda4f1a2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,146,86,185,142,23,206,145,98,227,78,98,134,191,32,205,164,241,162,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
