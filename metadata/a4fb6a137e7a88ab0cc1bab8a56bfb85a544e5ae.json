Released in August 2001 by London Records, this was the group's first album in eight years, following 1993's Republic.\n\nPeter Hook said of the album's title, &quot;The title of the album is 'Get Ready' so it could mean anything or nothing. I thought it was just nice, New Order, 'Get Ready', 'cos we are, we're getting ready for the next phase of our musical lives both physically and mentally so it's quite a simple thing but it's very pertinent.&quot;\n\nThe album was dedicated to Rob Gretton, the manager of Joy Division and New Order, who died in 1999.\n\nThe album features a cover art directed by Peter Saville and designed by Howard Wakefield who have also designed covers for New Order and Joy Division albums. The cover model is German actress Nicolette Krebitz.\n\nGet Ready (2001)\n----------------\n\nAll songs written and composed by Gilbert/Hook/Morris/Sumner.\n\nIn memory of Rob Gretton\n\nLyrics encoded in comment section of files\n\n1.\t&quot;Crystal&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:51\n2.\t&quot;60 Miles an Hour&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:35\n3.\t&quot;Turn My Way&quot; (featuring Billy Corgan) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:05\n4.\t&quot;Vicious Streak&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:40\n5.\t&quot;Primitive Notion&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:44\n6.\t&quot;Slow Jam&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53\n7.\t&quot;Rock the Shack&quot; (featuring Bobby Gillespie) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:12\n8.\t&quot;Someone Like You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:42\n9.\t&quot;Close Range&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:13\n10.\t&quot;Run Wild&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:59","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4fb6a137e7a88ab0cc1bab8a56bfb85a544e5ae","amp;dn":"New+Order+-+Get+Ready+2001+-+EAC+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4fb6a137e7a88ab0cc1bab8a56bfb85a544e5ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,251,106,19,126,122,136,171,12,193,186,184,165,107,251,133,165,68,229,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
