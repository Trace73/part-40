The complex emotions involved when someone you love becomes violent are also exposed, as are the difficulties for police when those feelings mean victims are not completely honest.\r\n\r\nWith an unfolding, present tense narrative, the film also exposes the lack of consistency in terms of the length of sentence given to offenders. When the police repeatedly take one perpetrator to court only to have magistrates release him again and again, the film demonstrates how the huge ordeal of going to court for these victims of domestic abuse does not mean that, in their eyes, justice will automatically follow.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 014 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 1s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 402 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 306 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cb7d5d04876f9ccf00246df1ad9736b2f6857a7","amp;dn":"BBC+Behind+Closed+Doors+720p+x264+HEVCguy+mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cb7d5d04876f9ccf00246df1ad9736b2f6857a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,183,213,208,72,118,249,204,240,2,70,223,26,217,115,107,47,104,87,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
