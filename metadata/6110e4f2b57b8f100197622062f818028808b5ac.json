Gregg\n\nAuthor of The Power of Non-Violence\nActing Director of Pendle Hill 1935-36\n\nPublished by Pendle Hill\nA Quaker Center for Religious and Social Study\nWallingford, Pennsylvania\n1936\n\nEXCERPTS:\n\nVoluntary simplicity of living has been advocated and practiced by the founders of most of the great religions: Buddha, Lao Tse, Moses and Mohammed,and also by many saints and wise men such as St. Francis, John Woolman, the Hindu rishis, the Hebrew prophets, the Moslem sufis; by many artists and scientists; and by such great modern leaders as Lenin and Gandhi. It has been followed also by members of military armies and monastic orders,ÃƒÂ¢??organizations which have had great and prolonged influence on the world. Simplicity has always been one of the testimonies of the Mennonites and of the Society of Friends.\n\nXXX\n\nVoluntary simplicity involves both inner and outer condition. It means singleness of purpose, sincerity and honesty within, as well as avoidance of exterior clutter, of many possessions irrelevant to the chief purpose of life. It means an ordering and guiding of our energy and our desires, a partial restraint in some directions in order to secure greater abundance of life in other directions. It involves a deliberate organization of life for a purpose. For example, the men who tried to climb Mount Everest concentrated their thoughts and energies on the planning of that expedition for several years, and in the actual attempt discarded every ounce of equipment not surely needed for that one purpose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6110e4f2b57b8f100197622062f818028808b5ac","amp;dn":"The+Value+of+Voluntary+Simplicity.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6110e4f2b57b8f100197622062f818028808b5ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,16,228,242,181,123,143,16,1,151,98,32,98,248,24,2,136,8,181,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
