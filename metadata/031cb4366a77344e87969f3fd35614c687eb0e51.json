Fanny Ardant plays a novelist named Judith whose famous works might have been ghost-written by a serial killer dubbed &quot;The Magician&quot; for his habit of performing acts of prestidigitation in front of his victims. Early in the film, the police quiz her about her relationship with the criminal. Other characters include a hairdresser (Audrey Dana) who offers to give a ride to a stranger who may be the killer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:031cb4366a77344e87969f3fd35614c687eb0e51","amp;dn":"Roman+de+Gare+aka+Crossed+Tracks+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"031cb4366a77344e87969f3fd35614c687eb0e51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,28,180,54,106,119,52,78,135,150,159,63,211,86,20,198,135,235,14,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
