Like honey-glazed ribs and whiskey. \nMoon Martin may have looked like a geek, with his huge, round eyeglasses and bowl-cut hairdo, but his music packed a delicious power-pop punch. But in the music business, regardless of your talent, your &quot;look&quot; is often the factor in determining your success, thus, homely Moon Martin was left out in the cold, despite a flair for writing ultra-catchy songs. \nRobert Palmer went on to have a mega-hit with Martin's &quot;Bad Case of Lovin' You,&quot; and even the band Mink DeVille enjoyed success with a cover of &quot;Cadillac Walk,&quot; but I still prefer the Moon Martin versions. And those two songs comprise just a fraction of the treasure trove of musical jewels that Moon Martin wrote and performed during his abbreviated career. \nYou can't go wrong with this CD: it really is a fine &quot;Best of&quot; collection.
