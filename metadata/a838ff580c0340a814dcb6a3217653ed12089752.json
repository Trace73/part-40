But this is just my opinion, I respect of course people that donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t agree with me.\n\nthe version uploaded here is Part I (RR 2314-3), that comes in a slimcase and includes the first four tracks of the tracklist below.\n\nhe first Sepultura show was on December 4th, 1984. The band played two songs that never were re-recorded or released.\n\nLine-up of the first show:\nWagner &quot;Antichrist&quot; - Vocals\nMax &quot;Possessed&quot; - Guitars\nIgor &quot;Skullcrusher&quot; - Drums\n\nThe band has changed a lot since their early days. They started out as Death Metal (Bestial Devastation, Morbid Visions), moved to Thrash Metal (Schizophrenia, Beneath The Remains, Arise), then Groove/Thrash Metal (Chaos AD) to Alternative/Nu Metal (Roots) and to Groove/Hardcore from there.\n\nA VHS tape called &quot;Live Reviews&quot; was released by Roadrunner in 1992/93.\n\nMax Cavalera left the band in December 1996, when the band clashed with his wife and band manager Gloria. He went on to form the Alternative/Nu Metal band Soulfly. Derrick Green, originally from Cleveland, Ohio replaced Max.\n\nThe band name comes from a Portuguese translation of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead's song &quot;Dancing On Your Grave&quot; which is &quot;DanÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ando Na Sua Sepultura&quot;. Sepultura means &quot;grave&quot; in Portuguese (and in other Latin-based languages).\n\nRoy Mayorga (Stone Sour, Soulfly, Amebix) filled-in for Igor during the European tour with In Flames in 2006.\n\nBirth dates:\nMassimiliano AntÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´nio Cavalera (4th August 1969 Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil)\nIgor &quot;Iggor&quot; Graziano Cavalera (4th September 1970 Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil)\nAndreas Rudolf Kisser (24th August 1968 Sao Paulo Bernardo do Campo, Brazil)\nPaulo Xisto Pinto Jr. (30th April 1969 Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil)\nDerrick Leon Green (20th January 1971 Cleveland, OH)\nJean Turrer Dolabella (14th May 1978, Uberaba, Minas Gerais, Brazil)\n\n\nSingle, Roadrunner\nAugust 5th, 1996\n\nThere are two different versions of this CD single:\nPart I (RR 2314-3) comes in a slimcase and includes the first four tracks of the\ntracklist below.\nPart II (RR 2314-5) comes in a digipack and includes the first two and the last\ntwo tracks of the tracklist below.\n1.
