Chorus hits hard as does the lyrical direction:\n\nThere was a man 2000 years ago\nWho died upon a tree\nMocking Him today, call Him lunatic prophet\nFather of all heresies\nNot seeing the truth in why He died\nTo save the souls of you and me\n\nYou mock the purpose of the cross\nHe shed His blood for you\nHe died upon a lonely tree\nTo save you from all sinÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ eternal doom\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WorksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ slows things to a technical mid-paced romp.  Approaching doom-metal territory, the song proves dark and low-key with its grinding rhythm section and tempo changes over the final half including another extended instrumental excursion.\n\nThe doom-ish emphasis continues on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second ComingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an unrelenting slug fest that ranks with the albums heaviest.  But it is not all driving in that quite the copious melody can be found as well.  The lone complaint is that the song fades out prematurely in coming in at just under three minutes.  Lyric snippet:\n\nBut as it was in the days of Noah\nSo shall the coming of the Son of Man be\nWatch therefore you know not the hour\nOf the Bridegroom is at hand\n\nBe ready in and out of season\nYou know not the hour or the day\nGive your life to Jesus Christ\nSo you can go when He calls His bride away\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“America Wake UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stands out with its commanding bass line.  The song plods forward from the start, driven and substantial during its verses but gaining momentum for a spirited chorus backed by a rollicking drum presence.  The band remains in real tight form here.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ShoutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ falls somewhat flat, at least in comparison to those preceding it.  The song takes a bluesy hard rock heading in picking up the tempo but lacks the catchy hooks for repeated play.  A bit too plain and generic is the overall feeling at hand.  Lyric snippet:\n\nJesus my Saviour, the King that rules\nHis Word I carry like a two edged sword\nHe helps me with my earthly duels\nI walk with Him in His Word everyday\nBecause He shows through His Word He saves\n\nShout His name, yeah\nPraise His name on high\nShout His name, yeah\nSo people see His light\n\nA much better effort can be found in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Give InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  A return to all out heaviness, the song highlights an underpinning technical milieu and understated melody that better represents the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s potential.  Chorus romps with abandon while the rhythm section settles into a fixed low-end groove.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Holy PsychotherapyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ proves spirited from the get go.  The song kicks up a storm of forthright impetus, rushing its distance to a foundational bass line and unremitting hooks in abundance.  The infections energy almost brings to mind Stryper.  Lyric snippet:\n\nTime after time, day after day\nReturning to your emetic state of being\nLooking to alcohol to show you the way\nDying in your sin without even seeing\nYour spirit is in eminent decay\nYou need to see a doctor who can make your spirit free\n\nHoly Psychotherapy\nRedemption of your soul\nLet Jesus make you whole\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Revelation ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ represents this reviewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s choice track.  It starts with the songs variety, ranging from verses that start heavy hitting but decelerate to a quieter touch at the end and a precisely done chorus bordering on commercial in capacity (very catchy and certain to have you returning time and again).  A quintessential joining of the melodic and heavy can be found here.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We Were OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a praise filled rocker with a mirthful disposition, does not quite cut it.  Similar to Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShoutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the song failed to grow on me in that it lacks the notable hook to gain my repeated interest.  The technical elements of the albums better material cannot be found here.  Lyric snippet:\n\nWe must dress up in His armor\nYe soldiers of the light\nBear each others burdens now\nAnd stand against the night\nTo acknowledge all His names\nAnd to sing unto Him praise\nFor you know, know we are one\n\nWe are one in the power of loveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“FaithÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ closes things in monster fashion.  This one is doom metal all the way, with trudging guitar riffs and hulking low-end playing dominant roles.  The swarthy - almost haunting - atmosphere finds Benson in his natural element in no uncertain terms.\n\nAs for the bonus tracks, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crushing The Dark CathedralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hits with a ton of bricks while delivering an understated melody in the process.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark StarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear AleisterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are ominous plodders, caustic and bitter slabs of grinding metal but delivering enough gripping catchiness to hold up under repeated play.\n\nIf you are looking for a Christian alternative to Ozzy then you will find it in David BensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Purpose Of The Cross.  Again, this is not a substandard impersonation of the original but rather brings some very good songs that stand up quite well on there own.  Benson, at the same time, does a fine job nailing the Ozzy style vocal approach.  Only some musical inconsistency and lack of great soloing hold things back.\n\nReview by Andrew Rockwell\n\nTrack Listing: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Purpose Of The CrossÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:19), Ã¢â‚¬Å“WorksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:58), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Second ComingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2:58), Ã¢â‚¬Å“America Wake UpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:59), Ã¢â‚¬Å“ShoutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2:52), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Give InÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:49), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Holy PsychotherapyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:56), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Revelation ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:37), Ã¢â‚¬Å“We Were OneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2:57), Ã¢â‚¬Å“FaithÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:49), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crushing The Dark CathedralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:07), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crushing The Dark CathedralÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:07), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark StarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (4:22), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear AleisterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (3:28),\n\nMusicians\nDavid Benson - Lead Vocals\nChris Grey - Guitars\nEddie West - Guitars &amp; Keyboards\nBryn Wilson - Guitars\nMark Selby - Bass\nKeith Trevor - Bass\nLee Paddgett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3403eccd576f6006177e5ea4d32e715ec71f2209","amp;dn":"David+Benson+Purpose+of+the+Cross","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3403eccd576f6006177e5ea4d32e715ec71f2209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,3,236,205,87,111,96,6,23,126,94,164,211,46,113,94,199,31,34,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
