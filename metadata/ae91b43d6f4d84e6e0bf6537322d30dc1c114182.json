Each episode was an eclectic, freeform mix of blues, folk, rockabilly, R&amp;B, soul, bebop, rock-and-roll, country and pop music, centered around a theme such as &quot;Weather,&quot; &quot;Money,&quot; and &quot;Flowers&quot; with songs from artists as diverse as Patti Page and LL Cool J. Much of the material for the show's 100 episodes was culled from producer Eddie Gorodetsky's music collection, which reportedly includes more than 10,000 records and more than 140,000 digital files.\nInterspersed between the music segments were email readings, listener phone calls, vintage radio air checks, old radio promos and jingles, even older jokes from Dylan (&quot;My grandmother is so tidy she puts newspaper under the cuckoo clock&quot;), poetry recitations; taped messages from a variety of celebrities, musicians and comedians; and commentary from Dylan on the music and musicians as well as miscellanea related to the themes. The show was not live (Dylan taped his portions at various locations and while touring), and the studio location at the so-called &quot;Abernathy Building&quot; was fictitious. Most of the &quot;listener phone calls&quot; and emails were also fictitious, although at least one email read on the show came from an actual listener.\n\n\n&quot;WEATHER&quot;\n\nGenre: Music show\nRunning time: 1 hour per episode, weekly\nCountry: United States\nHome station: Deep Tracks - XM 40 - SIRIUS 16\n\nStarring:\nBob Dylan\nEllen Barkin (announcer)\nPierre Mancini (announcer)\n\nCreators: Bob Dylan - Eddie Gorodetsky\nWriters: Eddie Gorodetsky\nExec. producers: Eddie Gorodetsky\nAir dates: May 3, 2006 to April 15, 2009\nNo. of episodes: 100\n\n\nFormato: MP3\nQualitÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  (Bitrate): 160 kbps\nDimensione: 69,5 MB\n\n\n.: TRACKLIST :.\n  \n01 Opening, Muddy Waters intro                                        \n02 Blow, Wind, Blow                                                   \n03 Windy cities, jungle, intro Jimmie Davis intro                     \n04 You Are My Sunshine                                                \n05 Outtro Jimmy Davis, intro Joe Jones                                \n06 California Sun                                                     \n07 Outtro Joe Jones, intro Dean Martin                                \n08 I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine                                \n09 Intro Prisonaires                                                  \n10 Just Walking in the Rain                                           \n11 Theme Time, intro Consolers                                        \n12 After the Clouds Roll Away                                         \n13 Outtro Consolers, intro Jimi Hendrix                               \n14 The Wind Cries Mary                                                \n15 Come Rain or Come Shine (Bob Dylan intro)                        \n16 Outtro Judy Garland, intro Irma Thomas                             \n17 It's Raining                                                       \n18 Didn't It Rain  (St Basil quote + Sarah Silverman)                \n19 Intro Slim Harpo, a wife like that                               \n20 Raining in my Heart                                                \n21 Outtro Slim Harpo, Taxi Driver clip, intro Lord Beginer          \n22 Jamaica Hurricane                                                  \n23 WSPA jingle, intro Fats Domino, New Orleans                        \n24 Let the four Winds Blow                                            \n25 Jingle, intro Spaniels                                             \n26 Stormy Weather                                                     \n27 Outtro Spaniels, outtro Stevie Wonder                              \n28 A Place in the Sun (Italian)                                       \n29 Outtro Stevie, Weast Coast weather, Frank intro                    \n30 Summer Wind (Bob Dylan intro)                                    \n31 Uncloudy Day (Bob Dylan intro , tremolo bar)                     \n32 Keep on the Sunny Side (Bob Dylan intro, sun joke)               \n33 Credits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae91b43d6f4d84e6e0bf6537322d30dc1c114182","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+TTRH+-+Weather+%5BMp3+160Kbps%5D+%5BTNTvillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae91b43d6f4d84e6e0bf6537322d30dc1c114182","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,145,180,61,111,77,132,230,224,191,101,55,50,45,48,220,28,17,65,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
