Grinding distorted guitars meet archaic drums in an ashen no-man's land where culture and good taste evaporate in the dessicating wind of social unease. Confusion, pain and rebellion seethe through discordant layers of jagged noise.\n\nreleased 11 September 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf58869612bf5f34a394360662da1276829821f","amp;dn":"DJ+Sarcastic+-+Distort+the+Artifacts+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf58869612bf5f34a394360662da1276829821f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,245,136,105,97,43,245,243,74,57,67,96,102,45,161,39,104,41,130,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
