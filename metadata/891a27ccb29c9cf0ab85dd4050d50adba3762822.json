The\nLos Angeles Times hails Merritt as &quot;one of indie-rock's most acclaimed\nfigures&quot; while Pitchfork calls him &quot;smart, thorough, and unerringly\nprecise.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:891a27ccb29c9cf0ab85dd4050d50adba3762822","amp;dn":"Stephin_Merritt-Obscurities-2011-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"891a27ccb29c9cf0ab85dd4050d50adba3762822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,26,39,204,178,156,156,240,171,133,221,64,80,213,10,219,163,118,40,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
