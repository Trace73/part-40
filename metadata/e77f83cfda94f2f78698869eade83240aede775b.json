But whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d want to kill an innocent small-time newspaperman?\n\nEmerald Isle (A Stacy Justice Mystery #4)\nStacy Justice may be a witch, but she still wants a nice, normal twenty-ninth birthday. Unfortunately, Stacy rarely gets normal. As her grandmother, Birdie, plans a birthday ritual for Stacy, disastrous news derails the celebration: the magic cauldron that supplies the world's food has disappeared. And the last time it vanished, Ireland fell under the Great Famine. A secret society known as The Council decrees that if Stacy finds the cauldron, she?ll receive the coveted role of Seeker of Justice, and her mother will finally be freed from prison in Ireland. But the grandson of nasty council member Tallulah challenges Stacy for the role. If he finds the cauldron first, Stacy will never see her mother again. And if they both fail, the world will suffer an unimaginable fate.

It's a fun, fast-paced read, meant to tide readers over until Miller's and Annino's next full-length novels are released. However, it also works as a stand-alone to introduce new readers to the quirky paranormal world of the main characters. \n\nIt includes short excerpts from the paranormal novels &quot;Somebody Tell Aunt Tillie She's Dead&quot; and &quot;Opal Fire.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e77f83cfda94f2f78698869eade83240aede775b","amp;dn":"Stacy+Justice+Mystery+Series+-+Barbra+Annino","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e77f83cfda94f2f78698869eade83240aede775b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,127,131,207,218,148,242,247,134,152,134,158,173,232,50,64,174,222,119,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
