All tracks are instrumental except the last three. The music genre is rather eclectic with various instruments such as piano, violin, harp, flute, classic guitar, electric guitar, drums, harpsichord or synthesizer. Berserk ~ Forces is the only number sung in Japanese (composed and performed by Hirasawa) and is used in the series as the next episode preview theme and as the background music for several battle scenes. Tell Me Why is the opening theme composed and performed in English by the Japanese band Penpals. Waiting So Long is the ending theme composed and also sung in English by Silver Fins from Japan.\n\n\\ Eye of the Swarm Release // \n\n[nfo]//Eye of the Swarm Release \n\nTitle: Berserk Soundtrack\nDescription: The complete Berserk anime soundtrack and Millenium Falcon video game sound track.\nSize unzipped: 74 mb\nPassword: eyeoftheswarm\nReleased: 12-02-07\n\n\n// Eye of the Swarm  [/nfo]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5d3b8dc2645c3d0e5f173e0ae579f131ef8008c","amp;dn":"Berserk+Anime+%2B+Game+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5d3b8dc2645c3d0e5f173e0ae579f131ef8008c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,211,184,220,38,69,195,208,229,241,115,224,174,87,159,19,30,248,0,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
