To lead this great war-winning attack he has selected Sepp Deitrich's 7th SS Panzer Army, which will have as its point Colonel yon Dodenburg's elite SS Assault Regiment Wotan.But the veteran von Dodenburg does not agree with the aims of the objective - the crossing of the River Meuse and the drive to the key Allied supply port of Antwerp. He believes the objective, which will involve driving his great 60-ton tanks through the mountain roads of Belgium, to be impossible in winter.Von Dodenburg sets off without permission to cover the designated route, and finds it can be done after all - though only at great cost. But all the while Eisenhower has known the German intentions and in order to trap them has deliberately thinned his lines to allow the Germans to get through...Based on fact, Operation Fury is an action-packed story, full of deceit and counter-deceit in the highest places.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0cb5492bc75084e6429bb2325a0a4cdc3e04aee","amp;dn":"Operation+Fury+-+Leo+Kessler%28N00DL35%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0cb5492bc75084e6429bb2325a0a4cdc3e04aee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,203,84,146,188,117,8,78,100,41,187,35,37,160,164,205,195,224,74,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
