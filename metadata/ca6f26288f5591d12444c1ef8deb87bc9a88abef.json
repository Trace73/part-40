This release features much of the score heard in game as well as a wealth of bonus tracks. The bonus material includes alternate takes of a handful of cues, several tracks from the unused early alternate score, and original demo tracks composed early on for the game in order to get the gig!\nThe score features haunting work from a custom emotional string instrument known as the Bazantar (a cousin to the cello), as well as various synth elements which at times feature a full blown orchestra. These elements all make for a very cool (and unique) listening experience that is not to be missed!\n\nBuy MP3:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca6f26288f5591d12444c1ef8deb87bc9a88abef","amp;dn":"Lifeless+Planet+Soundtrack+-+Rich+Douglas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca6f26288f5591d12444c1ef8deb87bc9a88abef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,111,38,40,143,85,145,209,36,68,193,239,141,235,135,188,154,136,171,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
