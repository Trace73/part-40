One teen son sells heroin, the other sleeps with men. Her mother-in-law keeps bottled water and cupcakes under lock and key, selling them to the family. Two alcoholic writers cook up a plot to sell a manuscript as Hitler's memoirs, if Antonio will transcribe it in Hitler's hand. He won't, so they ask the German singer to intercede. Meanwhile, Gloria has given away one son to a sex-crazed dentist, and grandma picks up a pet lizard. Can this chaos be tamed?\n\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0088461/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c9342e93de918dbdcbde3c8d87af594e7fc24c4","amp;dn":"What+Have+I+Done+to+Deserve+This%3F+1984+DVDRip+Spanish+PLSub%28txt%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c9342e93de918dbdcbde3c8d87af594e7fc24c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,147,66,233,61,233,24,219,220,189,227,200,216,122,245,148,231,252,36,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
