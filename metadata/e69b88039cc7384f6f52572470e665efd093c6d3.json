Henderson (Editor), PDF\n\n\nThis superb collection of essays takes the study of Shakespeare on film to a whole new level, telling us where the discipline has reached and where we can go from here. From problems of film-acting and gender to cross-culturalism and pixelvision, the book covers an enormous range of approaches as it considers the full gamut of Shakespeare films (old and new; good, bad and indifferent). It may be a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Concise CompanionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but there is nothing skimped here; instead, the collection is as rich and provocative as one could imagine and as exhilarating as the films themselves. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e69b88039cc7384f6f52572470e665efd093c6d3","amp;dn":"Shakespeare+on+Screen%2C+A+Concise+Companion+to","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e69b88039cc7384f6f52572470e665efd093c6d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,155,136,3,156,199,56,79,111,82,87,36,112,230,101,239,208,147,198,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
