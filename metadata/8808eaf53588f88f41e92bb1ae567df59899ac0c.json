The swing players from the '30s and '40s were out of vogue in America, but in Europe audiences still flocked to see them; hence this recording session features a British rhythm section backing tenor legend Ben Webster and trumpeter and singer Bill Coleman.\nWhile this music has no surprises, it's delightful in its relaxed swing and joyous delivery. Webster and Coleman play well off each other and the band supports the two horn men with real panache. In particular, the Django Reinhardt-esque guitar playing of Jim Douglas adds a European flair to the proceedings. Highlights include the upbeat &quot;But Not For Me&quot; and the delicate ballad, &quot;For All We Know.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Pound Horn.flac\n02 - Moonglow.flac\n03 - Satin Doll.flac\n04 - For Max.flac\n05 - But Not For Me (Take 3).flac\n06 - But Not For Me (Take 4).flac\n07 - For All We Know.flac\n08 - Sunday.flac\n09 - Bill Coleman.flac\n\nPersonnel:\nBen Webster - tenor saxophone\nBill Coleman - trumpet, flugelhorn, vocals\nLennie Hastings - drums\nJim Douglas - guitar\nRon Rae - bass\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8808eaf53588f88f41e92bb1ae567df59899ac0c","amp;dn":"Ben+Webster+-+1967+-+Meets+Bill+Coleman+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8808eaf53588f88f41e92bb1ae567df59899ac0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,8,234,245,53,136,248,143,65,233,43,177,174,86,125,245,152,153,172,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
