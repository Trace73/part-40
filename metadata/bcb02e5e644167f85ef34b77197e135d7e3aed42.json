A few years ago, she landed a regular gig drawing a weekly strip for a handful of alternative weeklies, and those efforts make up this first collection of her work. Two serials reedited seamlessly into full-length stories, however, best show off Lay's imagination: in the title story, the heroine braves the afterlife to rescue the soul of her comatose boyfriend, while &quot;Invisible City&quot; is an epic tale about the blind potion-maker Madame Asgar and a lost tribe in the South American rain forest. All the stories are well-crafted, attractively drawn, and entertaining.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcb02e5e644167f85ef34b77197e135d7e3aed42","amp;dn":"Carol+Lay+-+Now%2C+Endsville","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcb02e5e644167f85ef34b77197e135d7e3aed42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,176,46,94,100,65,103,248,94,243,75,119,25,126,19,93,126,58,237,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
