That is, until the son of a rich banker and his wife are found murdered. \n\nTo the police it looks like a robbery gone awry. But then Koko develops an odd appetite for glue. Qwilleran doesn't spot the clue until his beloved Siamese's taste for paste tangles them in a web of love, danger, and their stickiest case yet!\n\nQwilleran - a prizewinning reporter with a nose for crime. Koko-a Siamese cat with extraordinary talents and a flair for mystery. Yum Yum-a lovable Siamese adored by her two male companions. The most unlikely, most unusual, most delightful team in detective fiction!\n\nRead by: George Guidall\n\nFrom 6 Audio CDs at 128 kbps in M4a format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aada5de28efd4df7d4b4e4905b56411f5aaf004","amp;dn":"Lilian+Jackson+Braun+-+The+Cat+Who+Sniffed+Glue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aada5de28efd4df7d4b4e4905b56411f5aaf004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,173,165,222,40,239,212,223,125,75,78,73,5,181,100,17,245,170,240,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
