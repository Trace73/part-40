First bought on vinyl in 75 [lent it to a girl that I met at the Apollo in Glasgow and never saw it or her again]... replaced it, bought it on tape for the car, then on CD as soon as it was released, and then on CD again when it was re-mastered.\nThe great thing about this particular release is that there is a bonus disc that is worth paying the money for alone ... The disc is made up from the much talked about, but until now un-heard 'Clover' sessions ...\nThe Clover sessions should have been the bands 2nd album for MCA, but they were cut from the label, and when they signed for Atlantic they took the songs with them and re-recorded most of them under the stewardship of the great Atlantic &amp; Aretha producer Arif Mardin.\nUnlike most demos this set is excellently recorded and the playing as you'd expect from the boys is awesome. There is a freshness and vitality to the recordings that in some instances is even better than the slick Atlantic release. There are also a couple of new songs on the Clover sessions, that didn't make the White Album.\nThe White Album itself is just pure class.. from the opening chords of 'You Got It' to a magic version of the Isley's 'Work To Do' to the legendary 'Pick up the pieces' every single song is worthty of inclusion.\nThe playing is immense, and the vocals shared by the great Hamish Stuart and Alan Gorrie are superb. I once read that AWB were the ultimate band ... on their own all very competent musicians, but as a unit .... Awesome.\nIf you don't own the White Album ... you gotta get it. If you do then you've still gotta buy this version for the 'Clover Sessions'\nThis is Soul Music at it's finest ... the fact that these guys were Caledonian Soul Brothers, who could play like the JB's with names like Hamish and Onnie was just a bonus to all us white boys with no rhythm.
