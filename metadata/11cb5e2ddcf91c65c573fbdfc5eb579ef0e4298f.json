Then, when things fizzled almost a decade later, Lov figured she might as well go solo. She immediately hitched up with Nettwerk, who have made her new solo career fully blossom, and now, just two months after the release of The Young Eyes EP , her stunning debut album Seasoned Eyes Were Beaming is here.\n\nAt each turn, Seasoned Eyes Were Beaming shows itself to be a unique art form. From the cover artÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delicate flower design to LovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s echoing folk tunes to the entire albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s riff on the idealism of youth, Lov marks a journey of the self thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both positive and reassuring. The music is as moody as expected, with heartfelt vocals and LovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seductive cool, which comes across as both dark and devious while still managing to sound somewhat heavenly.\n\nSurprisingly, Seasoned Eyes Were Beaming only features two of the five tracks from her recent EP, in turn consisting of eight catchy and hypnotic new tracks. Lov shows her versatility on this record with the inclusion of theatrical keyboard melodies and wavering guitar riffs. However, it must be noted that Seasoned Eyes Were Beaming carries a sound reminiscent of the languorous pop melodies she created with Devics.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Just Beneath The ChordsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts things off at a slow pace, with its unique marxophone backing melody that sparks feelings of a boat rocking gently amongst the waves. Now, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got no clue what a marxophone actually is then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be pleased to hear that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a rare fretless zither instrument with four sets of chord strings, pretty neat huh? After that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re hit with Ã¢â‚¬Å“FrankieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which stunningly showcases LovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shaky and distant vocals. Later on, the haunting piano melody of Ã¢â‚¬Å“New YorkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sends chills down our spines, as the title track knocks us back shortly afterwards with a quaint guitar melody and the muffled tap-tap of a snare drum.\n\nThe charming duet Ã¢â‚¬Å“AnimalsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring a musical dialogue between her and Alex Brown Church is a personal favorite. Essentially itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a breakup song, but it comes across as something much deeper than that, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s led steadily by a simplistic and jaunty guitar melody. Also, the eerie ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tell Me HowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another solid tune about relationships and inevitable breakups.\n\nWhat really makes this album stand out, however, is LovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s introspective and thought provoking lyrics. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Thousand BeesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Lov cries out almost quizzically, Ã¢â‚¬Å“how sweet is the revenge/when you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it anymore/how meaningless the defense/when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not fighting anymore.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then later on, Lov reminds us of how easy it is to get hurt in Ã¢â‚¬Å“FountainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when she remarks, Ã¢â‚¬Å“donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you wish you could throw your pennies back at them/fountain fountain/ we are the same.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that Lov has a way with words that hit hard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11cb5e2ddcf91c65c573fbdfc5eb579ef0e4298f","amp;dn":"Sara+Lov+-+Seasoned+Eyes+Were+Beaming+%5B2009%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11cb5e2ddcf91c65c573fbdfc5eb579ef0e4298f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,203,94,45,220,249,28,101,197,115,251,223,197,235,87,158,240,228,41,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
