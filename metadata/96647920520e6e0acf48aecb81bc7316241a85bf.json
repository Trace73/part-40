The 7&quot; single debut of the George Baker Selection was released by the label Negram, which misprinted the actual title of the song, which is &quot;Little Green Back (greenback meaning money) and &quot;greenback&quot; is the lyric actually sung. This has caused the song to be misnamed ever since. The B-side was &quot;Pretty Little Dreamer&quot;. \n\nThe song reached the number 9 position in the Dutch Top 40, and the number 3 position in Belgium. In the summer of 1970, it reached the number 16 position on the Cash Box magazine chart and 21 in the Billboard Top 100 in the U.S.. In 1992, when the song was used in the film Reservoir Dogs, it became an international cult classic. Also in 1992, the song reached the number 1 position in Japan, after it was used in a Japanese whiskey commercial. \n\nThis song is included in the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, and appears in the famous intro scene that leads into the opening credits. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Green_Bag&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Green_Bag&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LabeNAadA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/LabeNAadA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 5300kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:02\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
