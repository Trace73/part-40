Please seed and support the band in way way you can.\n\nUP THE IRONS...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3474b2aa0edb87ffc7d0c09fa7c41ee3078651d1","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+Death+On+The+Road+219kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3474b2aa0edb87ffc7d0c09fa7c41ee3078651d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,116,178,170,14,219,135,255,199,208,192,159,167,196,30,227,7,134,81,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
