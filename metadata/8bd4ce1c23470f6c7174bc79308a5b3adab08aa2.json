This book is much more than an observing guide, it's a way of learning your way round the night sky. It is written in an easy-going style ideal for 'dipping in' on the relevant day, or even reading from cover to cover.\n\nBuyers of the 2009 edition is not an updated copy of the previous volume, but rather a completely new book. All historical tie-ins, information and objects are completely fresh.\n\nUnaided-eye observers are offered an opportunity to view many objects or events, learn about their history, science and how just &quot;looking up&quot; can be rewarding. Binocular and small telescope users will find a wealth of things to view using simple star hop instructions and finder charts. For large-aperture telescope users looking for a challenge, some of the finest deep-sky objects are detailed, with finder maps and photographs.
