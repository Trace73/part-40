He just doesn't know it yet. He has no idea why someone would try to kill him, clearly that's exactly what happened. When an SUV forced Josh's car off the road and into a river, it might have been an accident. But when Josh looked up at the road, expecting to see the SUV's driver rushing to help him, all he saw was the driver watching him calmly...then giving him a &quot;thumbs down&quot; sign. That was merely the first attempt on Josh's life, all of them designed to look like accidents, and all of them very nearly fatal. With his time--and maybe his luck--running out and no one willing to believe him, Josh had better figure out who wants him dead and why...before it's too late.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1662a4c499e49ca2b74f5b1af260eb9907c33ccc","amp;dn":"Simon+Wood-Accidents+Waiting+To+Happen%2CMobi%2CKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1662a4c499e49ca2b74f5b1af260eb9907c33ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,98,164,196,153,228,156,162,183,79,91,26,242,96,235,153,7,195,60,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
