Easy, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re The Exploited. You simply move the music forward. After their seminal debut, PunkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Not Dead, The Exploited bring punk rock music closer to what would become speed metal and crossover-music with Troops of Tomorrow. This album is so full of energy and kinetic street-wise anger that the result is nothing short of a masterpiece. Originally released in 1982, Troops of Tomorrow explores ideas about metal by focusing more on complex guitar work and longer songs; however, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Oi!/hardcore punk foundation that defines this recordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s delivery.\n\nOrigin\tEdinburgh, Scotland\nGenres\tHardcore punk\nCrossover thrash,Street punk (early),Oi!

Originally a street punk band, The Exploited became a faster hardcore punk band with a heavy political influence. Formed in Edinburgh by Stevie Ross and Terry Buchan, who were later joined by ex-soldier Walter (&quot;Wattie&quot;) Buchan (Terry's brother), they signed to Secret Records in March 1981 and released their debut EP Army Life. The album Punks Not Dead followed in the same year. Despite many lineup changes, &quot;Wattie&quot; Buchan has remained as the leader, and the band continued into the 2000s and developed a worldwide following. In 2012 the band started writing material for a new album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d4e4b414212db71f73645b1bfbe61c0aeed440f","amp;dn":"The+Exploited-Troops+Of+Tomorrow+1991+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d4e4b414212db71f73645b1bfbe61c0aeed440f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,78,75,65,66,18,219,113,247,54,69,177,191,190,97,192,174,237,68,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
