It was released on their 1982 album Creatures of the Night.\n\nThe track was written by bassist/vocalist Gene Simmons and guitarist Vincent Cusano, although some versions of the album mistakenly credit Paul Stanley and Cusano. Cusano had been working with songwriter Adam Mitchell when he discovered that Mitchell had connections to Kiss, and Cusano made it a point to meet Simmons through Mitchell. After meeting and exchanging phone numbers with Simmons, the two got together and wrote &quot;I Love It Loud&quot; in addition to another song called &quot;Killer&quot;, which appeared on the Creatures album during the same writing session.\n\nThe song fades out, only to come back even louder, and then fades out a second time. This idea was taken from The Beatles' songs &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot;\n\nA video was filmed which featured the band, then officially consisting of Simmons, guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley, drummer Eric Carr and guitarist Ace Frehley, on stage performing the song while teenagers, watching them perform on television, are being hypnotized (or inspired) by their performance. Howard Marks, KISS's business manager from 1976 to 1988, stars as the father in the video.\n\nThe video was directed by Paul Davey and produced by John Weaver for Keefco. It also marked the final video for which Kiss wore their famous make-up before unmasking in 1983 and also the last Kiss video to feature Ace Frehley (excluding various television appearances Frehley did with the group in support for Creatures of the Night) before his departure later that year.\n\nThis was the last Kiss single to feature Simmons on lead vocals until &quot;God Gave Rock 'N' Roll to You II&quot; in 1991, and the last to feature Simmons as the sole lead vocalist until &quot;Unholy&quot; in 1992. He was however the lead singer of every song on the 'B' side of every single they did through the &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; album.\n\n\nKiss (more often styled as KISS) is an American hard rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid to late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured fire breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits and pyrotechnics. Before arriving at their current lineup, the band went through some lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons the last two members of the original lineup of the band. Counting the 1978 solo albums, Kiss has been awarded 28 gold albums to date, the most of any American rock band. The band has sold more than 40 million albums in the United States, of which 24 million have been certified by the RIAA and their worldwide sales exceeds 100 million records, making them one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best-selling bands of all time. The original 1973Ã¢â‚¬â€œ80 lineup consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass guitar), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals).\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_It_Loud&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_It_Loud&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6fxovndh9/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://postimg.org/image/6fxovndh9/&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 5338kbps\n   Audio: LPCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD, 16 bits]\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:05\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
