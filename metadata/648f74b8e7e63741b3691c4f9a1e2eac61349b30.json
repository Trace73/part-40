Waking from a coma in a deserted London hospital 28 days later, bicycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) takes to the deserted city streets in a state of mystified confusion. Joining forces with another group of survivors following a terrifying encounter in a seemingly abandoned church, Jim soon learns the truth behind the deserted streets and the menacing creatures that lurk in the shadows. It's soon revealed that the chimpanzees had been harboring a deadly virus that sends its victims into a furious, murderous rage, and in the days following the initial exposure, the entire population was nearly wiped out due to the resulting homicidal rampage. Is there still a glimmer of hope for humanity -- or has the deadly &quot;rage&quot; virus found its way to foreign shores and infected the entire planet?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648f74b8e7e63741b3691c4f9a1e2eac61349b30","amp;dn":"28+Days+Later%282002%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648f74b8e7e63741b3691c4f9a1e2eac61349b30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,143,116,184,231,230,55,65,179,105,28,79,154,30,46,172,97,52,155,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
