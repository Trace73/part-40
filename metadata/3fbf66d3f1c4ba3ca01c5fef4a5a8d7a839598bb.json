So this collection has 16 years of World title fights in the middleweight division, All in a Spoiler-Free chronological order (more or less). There are 20 disks in total.\n\n This collection includes all WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO Middleweight title fights from 1980 to 1993. Some British and European title fights feature along with a few eliminator bouts.....if my memory serves me correctly! Enjoy.\n\n This is Disk 2 of 20\n\n Not all the disks in this collection are PAL and some are Dual-Layer (DVD9).\n\n Watch history in the making as titles change hands and real legends of the ring are born. All bouts on this disk are for the WBA &amp; WBC Middleweight titles:\n\n Disk Two cover the years: 1980-1981\n\n Menu Screenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/198/jde6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/198/jde6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/834/58a2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/834/58a2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/37/qvc0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/37/qvc0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/138/1u6p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/138/1u6p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/35/ffyv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/35/ffyv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/841/epn4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/841/epn4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fbf66d3f1c4ba3ca01c5fef4a5a8d7a839598bb","amp;dn":"Middleweight+World+Title+Fights%281980-1981%29%28Disk+2%29-desspratt-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fbf66d3f1c4ba3ca01c5fef4a5a8d7a839598bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,191,102,211,241,196,186,60,160,28,95,239,74,90,141,122,131,149,152,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
