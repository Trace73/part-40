All praises are\ndue to Allah; we praise Him; we seek His help; we seek His forgiveness; and we\nseek His guidance. We seek refuge in Allah from the evil in our souls and the\nbadness of our deeds. For whomever Allah guides, there is none to lead him\nastray. And for whomever He allows to go astray, there is none to guide him. I\nbear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, for whom\nthere is no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and\nMessenger.\n\n\nBest Book For non-Muslims","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1446315731db048fdcc6da43accec3fa2bf8c0c5","amp;dn":"Allah%5C%27s+miracles+in+the+Qur%5C%27an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1446315731db048fdcc6da43accec3fa2bf8c0c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,70,49,87,49,219,4,143,220,198,218,67,172,206,195,250,43,248,192,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
