Their early material has been compared by critics to Deep Purple, but they slowly began moving for a more commercially accessible hard rock style. By the turn of the decade, the band's commercial fortunes changed and they released a string of UK top 10 albums, Ready an' Willing (1980), Come an' Get It (1981), Saints &amp; Sinners (1982) and Slide It In (1984), the latter of which was their first to chart in the US and is certified 2x platinum.\n\nThe band's 1987 self-titled album was their most commercially successful worldwide, and contained two major US hits, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Is This Love&quot;, reaching number one and two on the Hot 100. In 1988, Whitesnake was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. Slip of the Tongue (1989), was also a success, reaching the top 10 in the US and UK, and receiving a platinum US certification. The band split up shortly after this release, but had a reunion in 1994, and released a one-off studio album, Restless Heart (1997).\n\nWhitesnake officially reformed in 2002 and have been touring together since, releasing two studio albums, Good to Be Bad (2008) and Forevermore (2011). In 2005, Whitesnake was named the 85th greatest hard rock band of all time by VH1\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8853a5f09510d7bdd99ddc6016d9daa83345328","amp;dn":"Whitesnake+13+LP%27s%2B+1+EP+%2824-192%29%2B1CD%2816-44.1%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8853a5f09510d7bdd99ddc6016d9daa83345328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,133,58,95,9,81,13,123,221,153,221,198,1,109,157,170,131,52,83,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
