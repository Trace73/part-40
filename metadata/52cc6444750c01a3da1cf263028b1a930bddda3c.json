In the vivacious and cheerful atmosphere of Spain they evoke in their conversations memories of the wartime period they lived through as adversaries. Viewed from a historical perspective, they try to understand those characteristics of the ancient struggle for life and death, which were not sufficiently evident during the bloody conflict. Their conversations are interwoven with vivid pictures of BerkÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s personal recollections of wartime people and events. After returning from Italian internment, Berk joins the partisan army on the liberated territory. There he meets Kristina , a fanatic revolutionary, with whom he had collaborated before as a member of the underground movement. Although he is attracted by the girl, he is not fully at ease with her for he does not fully share her ideological  fervour. Soon afterwards he encounters Anton, an experienced fighter from the Spanish Civil War, with whom he makes friends and spends the greatest part of his partisanship until AntonÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s tragic death towards the end of the war. Their life experiences and dialogues represent, together with other wartime events revived in BerkÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s memory, a kind of counterpoint to the more rationally coloured conversations  with Bitter, while the frivolous setting of the contemporary tourist Spain stands out in bright contrast to the now and then painful recollections of this turning-point in history.\n\nNOTE : This movie was chosen by slovene film critics among the top 10 all time best slovenian films.[/QUOTE] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard01-26.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard01-26.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard02-27.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard02-27.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard03-29.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard03-29.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard04-26.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard04-26.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard05-25.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard05-25.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard06-18.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i497.photobucket.com/albums/rr334/little_gigabyte/Clipboard06-18.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------my rip-------\n\nalthough much of the rip seems poorly cropped, different segments of the film used different amounts of real estate so I had to manually crop in order to inctlude as much as possible.\n\nthank you pc_liver for uploading the DVD\n\n~~~~~~ Dovidjenja u sledecem ratu.avi ~~~~~~                                     \n                                                               \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,625,491,456                     \n                                                                                \n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:51:54                \nFrame Count:....................................167828             \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................608                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................432                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.407                     \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1735                 \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.264&quot;                     \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                   \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2           \n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
