Faddeev, L. Sominsky \n\nThis book of problems in higher algebra grew out of a course\nof instruction at the Leningrad State University and the Herzen\nPedagogical Institute. It is designed for students of universities\nand teacher's colleges as a problem book in higher algebra.\n\nThe problems included here are of two radically different types. On\nthe one hand, there are a large number of numerical examples aimed at\ndeveloping computational skills and illustrating the basic\npropositions of the theory. The authors believe that the number of\nproblems is sufficient to cover work in class, at home and for tests.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a rather large number of problems\nof medium difficulty and many which will demand all the ini-\ntiative and ingenuity of the student. Many of the problems of\nthis category are accompanied by hints and suggestions to be\nfound in Part II. These problems are starred.\n\nAnswers are given to all problems, some of the problems are\nsupplied with detailed solutions.\n\n\n  This book was translated from the Russian by George Yankovsky. The\n  book was published by first Mir Publishers in 1978.\n\n  All credits to the original uploader.\n\n  PDF | 3.4 MB | Pages: 318 | Bookmarked | OCR | Cover\n\n======================================\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n=+                                  +=\n=+ Released on TPB by mirtitles.org +=\n=+                                  +=\n=++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\n======================================\t\n\nTable of Contents\n\nContents \nPart I\nPROBLEMS\n\nCHAPTER I.
