His interest in Sartre led to intense study of Marxist literary theory and critical theory, particularly the thinkers associated with, and influenced by, the Frankfurt School.  Jameson marked his full-fledged commitment to Hegelian-Marxist philosophy with the publication of THE POLITICAL UNCONSCIOUS (1981), the opening slogan of which is 'always historicize'.  Perhaps his best-known book, POSTMODERNISM, OR, THE CULTURAL LOGIC OF LATE CAPITALISM (1991) presents a critique of modernism and postmodernism from a dialectical perspective.\n\nHis more recent contributions include ARCHAEOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE, a study of utopia and science fiction, and three related studies of dialectical theory: VALENCES OF THE DIALECTIC (2009), which includes Jameson's critical responses to Zizek, Deleuze and other contemporary theorists; THE HEGEL VARIATIONS (2010), a commentary on Hegel's 'Phenomenology of Spirit'; and REPRESENTING CAPITAL (2011), an analysis of Marx's 'Das Kapital'.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format:\n\n* ARCHAEOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE: The Desire Called Utopia and Other Science Fictions (Verso, 2005)\n\n* THE CULTURAL TURN: Selected Writings on the Postmodern, 1983-1998 (Verso, 1998) -- also available as EPUB\n\n* THE HEGEL VARIATIONS: On the 'Phenomenology of Spirit' (Verso, 2010)\n\n* THE IDEOLOGIES OF THEORY (Verso, 2008)\n\n* MARXISM AND FORM: Twentieth-Century Dialectical Theories of Literature (Princeton University Press, 1971)\n\n* THE POLITICAL UNCONSCIOUS: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act (Cornell University Press, 1981 / Routledge, 2002)\n\n* POSTMODERNISM, OR, THE CULTURAL LOGIC OF LATE CAPITALISM (Verso, 1991) -- also available as EPUB\n\n* REPRESENTING 'CAPITAL': A Reading of Volume One (Verso, 2011)\n\n* SARTRE: THE ORIGINS OF A STYLE (Yale University Press, 1961)\n\n* VALENCES OF THE DIALECTIC (Verso, 2009)\n\n______________________________\n\nNote: Jameson's essay on 'Modernism and Imperialism' (included in NATIONALISM, COLONIALISM AND LITERATURE [1999], co-authored with Terry Eagleton and Edward W.
