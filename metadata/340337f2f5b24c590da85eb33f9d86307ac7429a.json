Mason, an art director, is a responsible, workaholic family man with an undying loyalty to the brands he helps sell. By contrast, his writing partner, Conner, is a single, impulsive copywriter with the attention span of a teenager. The series follows the changing dynamics between these two friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:340337f2f5b24c590da85eb33f9d86307ac7429a","amp;dn":"Trust+Me+-+Season+1+%282009%29+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"340337f2f5b24c590da85eb33f9d86307ac7429a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,3,55,242,245,178,76,89,13,168,94,179,63,157,134,48,122,199,66,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
