Now a knitwear designer, Rengren brings us the result of her combined passions in Vintage Baby Knits, a charming collection of more than 40 contemporary updates of timeless baby patterns. Projects range from small, quick-to-knit items like hats, booties, and shrugs to larger, more challenging designs for sweaters, onesies, and dresses, including a lace christening gown. Beautiful photographs capture a bevy of adorable babies and toddlers wearing these knitted treasures. Also included are sidebars on baby fashion and knitting culture in this bygone era, and a complete reference section. Destined to be a classic itself, Vintage Baby Knits promises family heirlooms for 21st-century babies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a68a18b8cb202f6ebff750261d9f53ed6bb504ee","amp;dn":"Vintage+Baby+Knits%3A40+Heirloom+Patterns+from+the+1920s+to+the+19","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a68a18b8cb202f6ebff750261d9f53ed6bb504ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,138,24,184,203,32,47,110,191,247,80,38,29,159,83,237,107,181,4,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
