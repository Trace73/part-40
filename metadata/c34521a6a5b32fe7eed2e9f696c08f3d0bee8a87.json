But a paranormal expert approaches Jonathan with the unlikely: the ability to hear his wife from beyond the grave. Through a form of unusual communication known as EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon), Jonathan will finally be able to see his wife. But in doing so, Jonathan has drawn himself into a much more complex situation when his curiosity becomes an obsession. Only that obsession will have him confront those not of this world, and some of them don't approve of Jonathan's interference with their destructive nature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c34521a6a5b32fe7eed2e9f696c08f3d0bee8a87","amp;dn":"White+Noise+%282005%29+DVDrip+Eng+%5Bwulfy1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c34521a6a5b32fe7eed2e9f696c08f3d0bee8a87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,69,33,166,165,179,47,231,238,210,233,246,150,192,143,61,11,238,138,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
