Characters and alien wildlife are brought to life through a rigorous simulation and the game plays out as a tug-of-war between humans and nature on a planet full of opportunities and dangers. \nUnderstanding the alien environment is crucial - the resources you discover will provide a number of production options making you able to adapt when food gets scarce and equipment breaks. \n\nYour role \nIn this game you will not feel like a commander issuing orders, because the settlers have no command chain but rely on voting if they disagree. You will get the sense that you're part of the community, organizing your groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisions, not bossing them around. You do this by using the Pioneer Planning Unit, an instrument issued by the Tau Ceti Mission. You will feel like a member of the group, sharing their victories and failures. \nWe will keep polishing the A.I. to ensure that humans and animals act as realistically and independently as possible. \n\nSetting \nThe game takes place in a realistic sci-fi setting, in a plausible future without Faster-than-Light travel. \nThe year is 2238 and EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first and only interstellar colonization ship has reached the end goal of its 100 year journey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a terran planet in the Tau Ceti star system. 2100 humans will now make this planet their new home. There are no additional supplies or reinforcements coming in - they must make do with what they brought and what they can find. \n\n----------------------------------------\nEarly Access: Current features\nEpisode 1: The Lost Explorers \nWhen we first enter the world, we experience the aftermath of a landing operation gone desperately wrong. We follow a handful of scientists that are lost in the wilderness. They have narrowly escaped an alien swarm which attacked the landing area and scared off the colonists about to land. The scientists are now far away and forgotten by the newly settled and struggling colony, so chances of rescue are slim. \n\nNarrative scenarios \nIn these scenarios, you guide the explorers to survive by scouting the surroundings, locate useful resources and make improvised tools, weapons and structures. For food, you can hunt the elusive Ã¢â‚¬Å“thunder chickenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or try to spear the fish that inhabit the waters. There will be attacks by pack predators such as the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“twinklerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which emerges from the caves littering the landscape. To repel them you can construct ranged weapons and build fences, but to permanently end the threat you must locate their nests and come up with a way to clear them out. \nIf your explorers manage to survive long enough, they get rescued and rejoin the other settlers. This ends the scenario. Depending on which scenario you choose, a game lasts 1 hour or more. \n\nThe scenarios we have now are hand-made but we will quickly develop options to randomize things such as starting location, number of resources, camp members, enemies etc. \nWe will keep developing new scenarios with different objectives and features. \n\nNote: We currently do NOT have the possibility to SAVE and LOAD a game - this is on the list of things we want to develop (see below). \n\nSandbox maps \nIf you want a free-form experience, you will soon be able to play sandbox maps with limited narrative and unlimited play time. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ffa172313b7e2d574980a5090b264fb9a820315","amp;dn":"Unclaimed+World+version+0.0.0.15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ffa172313b7e2d574980a5090b264fb9a820315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,250,23,35,19,183,226,213,116,152,10,80,144,178,100,251,154,130,3,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
