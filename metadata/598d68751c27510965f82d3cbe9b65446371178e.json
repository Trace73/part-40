The authorities want his father to be made responsible of the deaths, but Andreu tries to help his father by finding out who truly killed them. In this search, Andreu develops a moral consciousness against a world of adults fed by lies. In order to survive, he betrays his own roots and ends up finding out the monster that lives within him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:598d68751c27510965f82d3cbe9b65446371178e","amp;dn":"Pa_Negre_CA_SubEN_720x384_H264_MP3.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"598d68751c27510965f82d3cbe9b65446371178e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,141,104,117,28,39,81,9,101,248,45,60,190,155,101,68,99,113,23,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
