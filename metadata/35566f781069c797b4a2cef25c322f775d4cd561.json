He tells the disturbing story of the Winter Olympics in Nazi Germany, the tense Olympic rivalry between East and West during the cold war, ending with the Miracle on Ice and the unforgettable, emotional Olympics in Sarajevo. \n\nSarajevo was a city that in 1984 chimed to the music of Bolero - Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean reminisce about their performance as if it was a dream. Just eight years later most of the Olympic sites were destroyed during the civil war.\n\nDan completes his journey in a little known Swiss village of MÃƒÂ¼rren where the blue riband event of the Winter Olympics, Alpine skiing, was first organised by a British man, Arnold Lunn. Did the British really invent the Winter Olympics? Not quite, but it is true that the British played and extraordinary role.\n\n\n \n \n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t4szg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03t4szg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n \n \n\n \nDan Snow's History Of The Winter Olympics (1x60 Minutes)\n\n\n \nPlus:\nPanorama - Putin's Games \n\nThe cost of the Winter Olympics in Russia has quadrupled to a record-breaking Ã‚Â£30 billion following allegations of massive corruption. Reporter John Sweeney investigates claims that lucrative contracts have been handed to President Putin's friends, and that billions have been embezzled by fraudsters and corrupt officials. \n\nDespite the huge cost of the games, thousands of Olympic workers say they have not been paid, and some claim they were tortured by the police when they tried to protest. The games in Sochi are supposed to be a showcase for modern Russia, but what do they really reveal about President Putin's state? \n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Dan Snow's History Of The Winter Olympics.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 700 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 15s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 651 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 15s\nBitrate                     : 1 531 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.204\nStream size                 : 649 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 59mn 15s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 108 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 45.7 MB (7%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 562 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35566f781069c797b4a2cef25c322f775d4cd561","amp;dn":"Dan+Snow%27s+History+Of+The+Winter+Olympics+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35566f781069c797b4a2cef25c322f775d4cd561","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,86,111,120,16,105,199,151,180,162,206,242,92,50,47,119,93,76,213,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
