In this, the first installment of the series, Daniel Macdonald introduces essential oils as powerful emotional healers. This groundbreaking manual bridges the gap between the physical and emotional aspects of essential oils and creates a user-friendly guide for taking charge of your emotional health.\n\nEach oil is written about with profound insight and understanding of its innate properties and gifts, and the result is as poetic as it is practical. This easy to follow reference manual will help you come to know the oils in a new way and more fully appreciate their distinct healing qualities. For long-time oil enthusiasts and beginners alike, Emotional Healing with Essential Oils will inspire you with the genius and beauty of Mother Nature's finest of gifts. This book is universal in nature and is therefore applicable to any and all quality lines of essential oils.\n\nIn this book you will find descriptions for 54 singe oils and 20 common blends. Please note: While the names of single oils are the same from one essential oil company to the next, the names of blends are generally not the same. Therefore in this book we have used a generic name for each blend. You may then determine which of your preferred company's oil blends matches which description in this book.\n\n                    --------------------------------------------------\n\nGood reviews at both goodreads and Amazon (as at 24 May 2014):\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455083-emotional-healing-with-essential-oils&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13455083-emotional-healing-with-essential-oils&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote 1: Have viewed both these uploaded files on my Samsung Note 10.1.\n The epub file with the Aldiko application by importing it and the mobi file in the Kindle app by copy/pasting into Kindle folder in onboard SD card.\n I sent the files to myself in an email (gmail). I saved the files (by default they go into the Ã¢â‚¬ËœDownloadsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ folder in the onboard SD card) then did the import and copy/paste.\n\nNote 2: Like with most electronic devices there is more than one way to do something. At this point in time the above is what I do.\nI have used utorrent for android which asks you when downloading where to download to. I have an additional SD card with folders set up on it which I use.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a12dbdc56eae381679707e57ef4f0fd328cfb268","amp;dn":"Emotional+Healing+with+Essential+Oils+by+Daniel+Macdonald+ebook+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a12dbdc56eae381679707e57ef4f0fd328cfb268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,45,189,197,110,174,56,22,121,112,126,87,239,79,15,211,40,207,178,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
