That one period of your life you always wanted to go back to? And live that life . . . one more time? When asked this, I closed my eyes and went back in my own past. And I thought . . . . . . of the days, when life's most complex choices had a simple solution of Akkad Bakkad Bambey Bo! . . . of the seasons when rains were celebrated by making paper boats. . . . of the times when waiting at the railway crossing meant counting the bogies of the train passing by. When I opened my eyes, it seems Like it Happened Yesterday! Like it was yesterday that I broke my first tooth and fell in love for the first time. Like it was yesterday, when I was about to lose my friend, and suddenly he became my best friend. I look back and it becomes a journey full of adventure. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry and I know I'm here because I was . . . Come, hold my hand, and take this trip with me. It will be yesterday for you, once again!\n\nLanguage \t  English\nPublisher \t  Penguin Books Ltd\nISBN \t          9788184759464\nPublication Date  2013-06-15","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d559862a7b7e8c4ebf2402f53bdf00de6695b3d","amp;dn":"%2AIndian+Novel%2A+-+Like+It+Happened+Yesterday+by+Ravinder+Singh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d559862a7b7e8c4ebf2402f53bdf00de6695b3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,85,152,98,167,183,232,196,235,242,64,47,83,189,240,13,230,105,91,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
