Flemington owns a model ship company and loves everything nautical. That's not his problem however: he likes everything to be loud. He speaks at the top of his lungs, bellowing commands to his staff. He plays his phonograph records - his favorites include the sound of jets flying off the deck of the USS Hornet - as loud as possible, something that leads his wife to leave him. He's not prepared for what happens to him in the Twilight Zone however.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efdafe2bd050a35e68860b3e151080ebd1d410bd","amp;dn":"The+Twilight+Zone+-+Sounds+And+Silences","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efdafe2bd050a35e68860b3e151080ebd1d410bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,218,254,43,208,80,163,94,104,134,11,62,21,16,128,235,209,212,16,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
