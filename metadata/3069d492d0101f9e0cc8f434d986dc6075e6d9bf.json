I am a vampire, and a murderer.\n\nHaving betrayed the trust of my own kind and that of the enemies I sold myself to, I have three days left to live. \n\nI stare at the girl in the cell opposite mine. Mona, she calls herself. A witch born without magic.\n\nShe might be my key to freedom, but I should know to stay away. \n\nI should know: some scars are etched too deep to heal.\n\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF, LIT\nASIN#: B00LJ82CK8\nPublished: September 26th, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3069d492d0101f9e0cc8f434d986dc6075e6d9bf","amp;dn":"A+Shade+of+Kiev+%28A+Shade+of+Vampire+%238%29+-+Bella+Forrest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3069d492d0101f9e0cc8f434d986dc6075e6d9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,105,212,146,208,16,31,158,12,200,244,52,217,134,220,96,117,230,217,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
