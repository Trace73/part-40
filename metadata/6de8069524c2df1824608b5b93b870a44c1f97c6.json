Get into Apparatus at your peril ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you will lose hours of your life!&quot; - LifeOfAndroid.com (Score: 9.5/10)\n\nConnect cables from batteries to motors, build bridges, set up teeter totters,\nswing with ropes, build vehicles, or just let the marble have a happy roller coaster\nride to the goal!\nUse the hammer or the wrench to connect planks, wheels and other objects together.\nUse the control panel to control your creations, be it a monster truck, a mechanical rifle or anything YOU can imagine!\nCreativity is essential in the gameplay Apparatus. If you don't have the patience to figure\nout the challenge levels, why not just play around in the physics sandbox and build whatever\ncomes to mind? Upload and share your levels in the community section or download and\ncomment on other players' levels.\nThe early levels will teach you how to play the game and go through some basic concepts.\nThe more you progress the more freedom the levels provide, many levels can\nbe solved in many different ways.\nEvery time you complete a level, you can go into freebuild mode and modify the level\nhowever you like. If you make the level better, or just harder, you might want to \nupload it to the community section and let other people play your modified level.\n\nEXTRA FUN ON TABLETS!\nOfficially supported phones and tablets:\n* Nexus One\n* Samsung Galaxy S\n* Samsung Galaxy S II (Please disable sound! This device crashes with sound on, we're working on a fix!)\n* HTC Desire HD\n* HTC Desire\n* Samsung Galaxy Tab\n* ZTE Blade\n* ZTE Light\n* Acer A500 Tablet\n* Motorola Xoom\n\nA minimum processor speed of 600MHz is recommended. A screen resolution of 800x480 or higher is recommended but the game runs on lower resolutions.\n\nIF YOU HAVE PERFORMANCE ISSUES:\nDisable sound effects and music from the main menu.\nIf the game still runs slow, when in a level click the menu button and choose &quot;Graphics Settings&quot;. Disable shadow effects and put the rope/cable quality at 50%.\n\nGALAXY S II USERS:\nPlease disable sound/music in the game. The audio backend crashes on this phone and we're working on solving this as soon as possible!\n\n\nInstallation Notes:\n\n1) Go to settings - applications - enable the 'unknown sources' option.          \n2) Put the .apk files somewhere on your SD card.                                 \n3) Open your file manager on the device (like Astro Manager from market). \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739487/ASTRO_File_Manager_pro_v3.0_apk_android_[szoheb]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6739487/ASTRO_File_Manager_pro_v3.0_apk_android_[szoheb]&lt;/a&gt;\n                    \n4) Select a .apk file.                                                           \n5) If you get the 'complete action using' pop-up, choose 'package installer'.\n\nScreens :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paKdlAADM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/paKdlAADM&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease SEED..!! =)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6de8069524c2df1824608b5b93b870a44c1f97c6","amp;dn":"Apparatus+Paid+v1.0.4+apk+android+szoheb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6de8069524c2df1824608b5b93b870a44c1f97c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,232,6,149,36,194,223,24,36,96,139,91,147,184,112,164,76,31,151,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
