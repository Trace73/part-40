He called it &quot;the hero's journey.&quot; Finding Joe explores how the hero's journey is relevant and essential in today's world. It provides a narrative for how to live a fully realized life or, as Campbell would simply state, how to &quot;follow your bliss.&quot; The film takes us on an inspirational quest of self-discovery. As you slay dragons and uncover treasures, you just may find that the holy grail you seek is closer than you think.
