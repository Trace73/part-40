Inspired by ACDC, Rose Tattoo, Chuck Berry, Status Quo, Johnny Thunders etc. \n\n\nAlan Lancaster (Status Quo):\n\nThe members of Backstreet Girls are a testament to the meaning of a ?real band?. No fancy gimmicks; no silly recording tricks; no compromises. Listeners are instinctively confident that they are experiencing the empathy, excitement, and the ?hard sweat factor? of ?live? musicians; rather than an index finger on a digital sound module.\nI was impressed with the enthusiasm and attitude of the Backstreet Girls, when I was introduced to them at one of my concerts in Norway. It reminded me of when ?Status Quo? started to emerge on the ?rock scene?; very confident, very sure, and very much their own band. I heart wafts of the original Status Quo-sound. I like the ?weightly? but relaxed and controlled fell of the Bass &amp; Drums; the precision and energy of the Rhythm Guitar (superb control of it?s powerful sound); the intelligent licks, solos and syncopation of the Lead Guitar, empathising with the vocalist; the Vocals? strong low notes and powerful highs ?living? the lyrics, through tragedy, fun &amp; humour ? a special and unique vocal quality (in tone &amp; performance), which is ?coolly? understated.\nThere are no keyboards? The members have been together for many years, and have more than paid their dues; writing; performing; and recording with passion.\nSurely this band is only a blink away from the ?big time?.\n\n\n320kbs\nCovers included\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
