While spending a few weeks in Bath with a family friend, Catherine meets and falls in love with Henry Tilney, who invites her to visit his family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Catherine, a great reader of Gothic thrillers, lets the shadowy atmosphere of the old mansion fill her mind with terrible suspicions. What is the mystery surrounding the death of HenryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother? Is the family concealing a terrible secret within the elegant rooms of the Abbey? Can she trust Henry, or is he part of an evil conspiracy? Catherine finds dreadful portents in the most prosaic events, until Henry persuades her to see the peril in confusing life with art.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6598dc1dcd3b452d5e21c34fcc9aa938d09530","amp;dn":"Northanger+Abbey-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6598dc1dcd3b452d5e21c34fcc9aa938d09530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,101,152,220,29,205,59,69,45,94,33,195,79,204,154,169,56,208,149,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
