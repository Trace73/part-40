Formed in March 2001 they combined emotional hardcore with ambient instrumental music.\n\nIn July 2001 they released their first self-titled demo tape containing 2 tracks, followed by the contribution of 3 songs to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Change It From Ideal To RealÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ split CD of February 2002. With the release of their MCD Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hardcore EmotionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2003, they quickly established themselves as a leading band in the japanese hardcore scene.\n\nAfter two members left the band for unknown reasons, a planned CD release for August 2006 was cancelled. They played their last show on January 8, 2006. \n\n==================================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Siddhartha\n\n#KeepSeeding!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cecc905abc83926b92af611986bcaf32ad2e0b0f","amp;dn":"Naiad+-+Hardcore+Emotion+%5BReissue%5D+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cecc905abc83926b92af611986bcaf32ad2e0b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,204,144,90,188,131,146,107,146,175,97,25,134,188,175,50,173,46,11,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
