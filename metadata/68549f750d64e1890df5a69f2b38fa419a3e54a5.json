Wild Sex: Deviants?\n\nDeviants? tracks some of the oddest sexual behavior in the known world. Humans aren?t the only ones to experiment with different sexual practices. When it comes to ?deviant? sexual behavior, animals can put human efforts to shame. In the animal world deviancy isn?t just tolerated, it?s a way of life. This is an extraordinary world of weird sex, of sex without reproduction, and reproduction without sex. Animals have perfected inventive methods of masturbation, and homosexual activities. Orangutans can actually invert their male organ to create a cavity for another male to penetrate. In nature, it?s as if there are no limits. Sex solely for the sake of reproduction? This film exposes that notion as a myth. Learn how asexuals, hermaphrodites, homosexuals, and transvestites are just a gentle introduction into what looks like a sex-crazed animal world. Animals have learned to get what they want, when they want it, and in ways which (to humans at least) might seem extreme.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68549f750d64e1890df5a69f2b38fa419a3e54a5","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Wild+Sex+6of6+Deviants+DVB+XviD+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68549f750d64e1890df5a69f2b38fa419a3e54a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,84,159,117,13,100,225,137,13,245,166,159,43,56,250,65,154,62,84,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
