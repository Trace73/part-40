A mob of tiny rodents live la vida loca, led by the trash-talking bully Moe and his trash-talking sidekick Preston. Add in Nubbins, the big guy; poor, sweet crapball-lovin' Aldo and a rotting corpse turned playground, and you'll never find a more moving affirmation of traditional values. Inspired by a bald bird sighting while the author was wandering Hunter's Hill in Sydney, Australia, this book is pure weirdness - just what Renee French fans dream of. With guest drawings by Jim Woodring, Penn Jillette, Dean Cameron, Dylan Williams, James Gunn and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3aa7ef9b7389f5e2845c6e3e3c3ae2c702fe27b","amp;dn":"Renee+French%3A+Micrographica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3aa7ef9b7389f5e2845c6e3e3c3ae2c702fe27b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,170,126,249,183,56,159,94,40,69,198,227,227,195,174,44,112,47,226,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
