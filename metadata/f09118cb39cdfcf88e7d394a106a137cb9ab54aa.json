The program scans any mounted disk and displays it on the sunburst map, where segments mean files and folders, proportionally to their sizes. The map is easy to read and navigate. You can also quickly preview any file and reveal it in Finder to delete.\n\nAnalyze disk usage\nDaisyDisk uses sunburst visualization to display disk usage. It's easier to read and navigate than rectangular treemaps used in other products.\n\nFantastic interface \nWho said disk tools have to be ugly and tangled? We strived to make DaisyDisk both easy to use and visually appealing.\nGet rid of disk space wasters \nFind a large file. Hit Space to preview its content. Right-click to reveal it in Finder. Delete the file. Done.\n\nMore than meets the eye \nWe took care of numerous details to make your experience with DaisyDisk as smooth as possible. And there's more to come. \n\nRequirements: Mac OS X 10.5 or later.\n\nLink for more information: http://www.daisydiskapp.com/\n\nPre-cracked by The One Byte Wonder , register with any name and phoney serial number  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f09118cb39cdfcf88e7d394a106a137cb9ab54aa","amp;dn":"DaisyDisk+1.5.1+%5BUB+k%5C%27d%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f09118cb39cdfcf88e7d394a106a137cb9ab54aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,145,24,203,57,205,252,248,142,125,57,74,16,106,19,124,185,171,84,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
