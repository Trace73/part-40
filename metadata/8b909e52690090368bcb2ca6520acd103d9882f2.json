The album was released in South Africa and Switzerland on\nOctober 19, 2007, and released worldwide on October 23, 2007. The cover artwork was\ndesigned by David Ho, the same artist who designed the Vicious Delicious cover for\nInfected Mushroom. The covers apparently display the same character: Candice the\nGhost. Three singles, &quot;Fake It&quot;, &quot;Rise Above This&quot; and &quot;Breakdown&quot; have been released from the album with all three being top 10 singles, the former two reaching the top position on several Billboard charts, despite negative reviews, scoring a 39% on Metacritic. The album was reissued in 2009, featuring a fourth single, a cover of George Michael's &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, the final single from the album. It is the first Seether album to reach gold status in their home country, South Africa.\n\n\nWe rip the descriptions from cduniverse, allmusic, and\namazon.
