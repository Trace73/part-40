The album was released on CD, LP and VHS in 1994, and remains the group's only release as a collective.\n\nThe album is an almost complete and unedited version of the concert. Their performance of John Lennon's &quot;God (The Dream Is Over)&quot; was not included on the album due to copyright issues. Keyboard player Spike Edney had to play a second solo (neither are on the CD, the first being on the video) after May had technical problems before playing &quot;Last Horizon&quot;. Also, &quot;Back To The Light&quot;, &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, &quot;Love Token&quot;, &quot;Headlong&quot;, &quot;Let Your Heart Rule Your Head&quot;, &quot;Resurrection&quot; (in particular, Cozy Powell's drum solo), &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot; are all slightly shortened on the CD, but appear in full on the 90-minute video of the same event. The spoken part after &quot;Love Token&quot; has been cut because it contained too many profanities, but it can be heard fully on the unofficial audience recording.\n\nThe show includes live renditions of the top ten singles &quot;Driven By You&quot; and &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot;.\n\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nAll tracks by Brian May, except where noted\n\n    &quot;Back to the Light&quot;\n    &quot;Driven by You&quot;\n    &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;\n    &quot;Love Token&quot;\n    &quot;Headlong&quot;\n    &quot;Love of My Life&quot; (Freddie Mercury)\n    &quot;'39&quot; / &quot;Let Your Heart Rule Your Head&quot;\n    &quot;Too Much Love Will Kill You&quot; (May, Frank Musker, Elizabeth Lamers)\n    &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot; (Russ Ballard)\n    &quot;Now I'm Here&quot;\n    &quot;Guitar Extravagance&quot;\n    &quot;Resurrection&quot; (May, Cozy Powell, Jamie Page)\n    &quot;Last Horizon&quot;\n    &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;\n    &quot;Hammer to Fall&quot;\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Brian May - Lead Vocals &amp; Lead Guitar\n    Cozy Powell - Drums &amp; Percussion\n    Neil Murray - Bass Guitar\n    Spike Edney - Keyboardist &amp; Backing Vocals\n    Jamie Moses - Rhythm Guitar &amp; Backing Vocals\n    Cathy Porter - Backing Vocals\n    Shelley Preston - Backing Vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9a42f8ced5956c5929a908a328935de35576d01","amp;dn":"The+Brian+May+Band+-+LIVE+At+The+Brixton+Acadamy+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9a42f8ced5956c5929a908a328935de35576d01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,164,47,140,237,89,86,197,146,154,144,138,50,137,53,222,53,87,109,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
