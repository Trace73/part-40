No weak link at all here, but a perfect ensemble totally in tune with every touch in the tale and seamlessly involved with chorus and orchestra at their peak â€“ the studio is no obstacle either to continuity or spontaneity and every detail is achieved with natural eloquence and ease. But the single presence that lifts this account head and shoulders above every other is Langridgeâ€™s extraordinary rendition of the central role: alive to every nuance in text and music his is the beating heart of a glorious performance and the very embodiment of the Jungian plea â€˜I would know my shadow and my light, so shall I at last be wholeâ€™, which becomes the lodestar and climax of the work as a whole. Of all these discs as heard in random sequence, this is the only one that had me suddenly in tears and catching my breath. Issued on its own RPO label but with favourite Previn producer Suvi Raj Grubb in charge, this priceless document is probably hard to obtain today â€“ it should somehow be reissued immediately.&quot; --Geraint Lewis (From the article &quot;Tippett's A Child of Our Time â€“ which recording should you buy?&quot; that originally appeared in the July 2014 issue of Gramophone)\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n01.
