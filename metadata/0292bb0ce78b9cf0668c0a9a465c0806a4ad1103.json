In fact, since youâ€™re reading this right now, I bet youâ€™re one of those people. Well, Iâ€™m here to tell you from experience that itâ€™s very possible, whether youâ€™re over your head in bills or not. Things can change, and youâ€™re obviously taking the first step. Why are more people searching for a way out of mainstream society these days? I think itâ€™s because life has become so complicated. \r\n\r\nThere are laws for everything you do. According to surveys, most people on average commit one or two felonies a day without even being aware of it. Thatâ€™s a scary thought. We have neighborhoods now with associations that dictate what, when and where you can place anything in your own yard that you pay for. We have law enforcement officers that are given illegal quotas for tickets they give out each month. Cameras are being placed all around us watching our every move with facial recognition software that logs everything you do. \r\n\r\nWhere you go, and what you buy. Our cellular phones track where we are. And make us available anytime day or night. No escape. We have schools that charge for education. We have careers that are repetitious and mind numbing. That of course, we need, in order to pay for the overpriced entertainment that we only need to help us escape the reality of the same job that pays for it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0292bb0ce78b9cf0668c0a9a465c0806a4ad1103","amp;dn":"Living+Free+-+Tips+and+Tricks+for+LIving+Off+Grid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0292bb0ce78b9cf0668c0a9a465c0806a4ad1103","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,146,187,12,231,139,156,240,102,140,10,154,70,92,8,6,164,173,17,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
