This is their collection, minus their self released CD-R &quot;Out With Rockers&quot; from 2009, which was mainly a demo version of 2011's &quot;Living For The Roll&quot;. It's not included as it's now tricky to find and could only be gotten from live shows leading up to 2011. I'll still attempt to track down a copy to update the discography. In the meanwhile, enjoy some wicked tunes, grab a couple beers and relax!\n\n\n(2011) Living For The Roll (CD)\n(2014) Hellalujah (CD)\n\n\nPLEASE, if you like ANY of this music, support the artist &amp; go out to buy the fucking album(s), see the bands in concert, buy their t-shirts, etc... I'm certain they'll gladly appreciate it, as it costs them money to record, to travel to perform, etc. and have bills to pay like everyone else.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a82f5f0c245f70a8c4debbd5b97fa6721485026e","amp;dn":"Dance+Laury+Dance+Discography+VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a82f5f0c245f70a8c4debbd5b97fa6721485026e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,47,95,12,36,95,112,168,196,222,187,213,185,127,166,114,20,133,2,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
