Hard to find!\n\nThe Special Tools list has the part number for the special feeler gauge (4180 893 6400) needed to adjust the valves after 150hrs, the clearance is 0.1mm.  The special gauge is needed because a regular one is too wide unfortunately, it has to be a finger about 1/8&quot; wide.\n\nI found these later, this torrent is to supplement the shop manual torrent I uploaded previously.
