Bach) Schickele&amp;#039;s award-winning themed classical \nmusic education and humor program, produced from 1992 to the late 1990s and \ndistributed in repeats until 2007.  This file contains in AAC format (playable in \niTunes and other players) 25 Schickele Mix programs.  Programs run approximately \n58 minutes each and are cut into around 12 tracks each for convenience (not cut \nby individual piece of music).  Note that programs 135 and 136 are incomplete; \nthey were, unfortunately (or perhaps not), edited down by the source of these \nairchecks to remove an excessive number of annoying novelty numbers.
