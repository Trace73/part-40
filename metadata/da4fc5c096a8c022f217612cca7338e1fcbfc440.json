Mascot made a third serial, The Adventures of Rex and Rinty, but that Rin Tin Tin was not the same dog.\n\nThe plot revolves around Rin Tin Tin as &quot;Rinty&quot; and a secret gold mine fought over by the criminal &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot; and the legitimate owners.

Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin (often hyphenated as Rin-Tin-Tin) and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherds as family pets. The immense profitability of his films made Warner Bros. studios a success and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck. In 1929, Rin Tin Tin may have received the most votes for the first Academy Award for Best Actor, but the Academy determined that a human should win.\n\nAfter Rin Tin Tin died in 1932, the name was given to several related German Shepherds featured in fictional stories on film, radio, and television. Rin Tin Tin, Jr. appeared in some serialized films but was not as talented as his father. Rin Tin Tin III, said to be Rin Tin Tin's grandson but probably only distantly related, helped promote the military use of dogs during World War II. Rin Tin Tin III also appeared in a film with child actor Robert Blake in 1947.\n\nDuncan groomed Rin Tin Tin IV for the 1950s television series The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, but the dog performed poorly in a screen test and was replaced in the TV show by trainer Frank Barnes's dogs, primarily one named Flame, Jr., called JR, with the public led to believe otherwise. Instead of shooting episodes, Rin Tin Tin IV stayed at home in Riverside. The TV show Rin Tin Tin was nominated for a PATSY Award in 1958 and in 1959 but did not win.\n\nSYNOPSIS:- Rin Tin Tin - The Lone Defender (1930)\nProspector Juan Valdez is murdered by The Cactus Kid and his gang in an attempt to discover the location of his gold mine. Valdez's dog Rinty witnesses the murder and can also lead the gang to the mine, making him the villain's target throughout the serial. In addition Rinty must help Valdez's daughter Dolores legitimately find and claim the mine while being blamed for the wolf attacking local livestock.\n\nThe mysterious figure of Ramon is constantly on hand, overhearing pieces of the villain's conversations. He appears to be another bandit but his actions seem to contradict that. \nIt is revealed during the course of the serial that Ramon is in fact Marco Roberto, an agent of the Justice Department.\n\nA prospector is murdered by The Cactus Kid and his gang, who hope to find the murdered man's goldmine. The miner's dog, Rin-Tin-Tin, recognizes the killers, who thereafter seek to use the dog to locate the lost mine. With the help of a government agent and a young girl, Rinty saves the mine and brings the bad guys to justice. \n\nAs they return from their secret mine in the desert, prospectors Juan Valdez and Burke are ambushed. Burke escapes but Valdez is shot and killed. A notorious bandit, The Cactus Kid, is suspected of the crime. Ramon, actually a Justice Department Agent named Marco Roberti, a mysterious figure, overhears a conversation between two townsmen, Halkey and Jenkins in which they discuss their failure to get the location map of the mine from Valdez. Rinty, Valdez's dog,recognizes Jenkins as his master's killer and attacks him. Halkey, actually &quot;The Cactus Kid&quot;, decides to capture Rinty as he thinks the dog can lead him to the mine. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 855 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 23.976\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams:  2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime 3:42:00\nSubtitles: None\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]\nDuration: 3:42:00\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4fc5c096a8c022f217612cca7338e1fcbfc440","amp;dn":"Rin+Tin+Tin+-+The+Lone+Defender+%281930%29+Xvid+-+Disk+1+-+Western+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4fc5c096a8c022f217612cca7338e1fcbfc440","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,79,197,192,150,168,192,34,242,23,97,44,202,115,56,225,252,191,196,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
