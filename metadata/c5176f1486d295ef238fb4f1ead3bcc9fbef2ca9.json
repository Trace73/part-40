Dedicated fascist Ugo Tognazzi is sent to capture anti-Mussolini professor Georges Wilson. He accomplishes his mission, but both captor and captive have a hard time getting home. After numerous comic misadventures in Tognazzi's motorcycle, the two men are caught in an air raid, the result being that both lose their clothing. Arriving in Rome, Tognazzi discovers that the city has fallen to the Allies--and now it is he, the fascist, who is in danger of capture and incarceration. Professor Wilson, who has grown fond of the essentially decent Tognazzi, rescues his ex-captor from an angry mob. \n\n   General\n      Complete name :Il Federale.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.12 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1642 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.80 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 15654/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : Yes\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1510 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 390 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.214\n      StreamSize : 1.03 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 88.0 MiB\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nItalian audio, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nIMDB: tt0054870","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5176f1486d295ef238fb4f1ead3bcc9fbef2ca9","amp;dn":"Il+Federale+%28The+Fascist%29+-+Luciano+Salce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5176f1486d295ef238fb4f1ead3bcc9fbef2ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,23,111,20,134,210,149,239,35,143,180,241,234,211,188,201,251,239,44,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
