Weakened, Superman still manages to crawl within striking distance as Arathaza gloats over her impending victory. Seizing the opportunity, Superman grabs her mystical staff, shattering it. Her staff destroyed, Arathaza reverts to her mortal form as Barb Kowaleski and is easily captured by Superman.\n\nLater, Superman is approached by the Phantom Stranger who teleports them both to the scene of a whirling mass of earth and stone near a graveyard. As superman attempts to contain the monster, the Stranger enters it and is transported to the kingdom of the dead and the undead there who are responsible for summoning the beast. The Stranger discovers that the undead are the souls of the wicked - murderers, rapists and robbers who used the power of the Sherabite Stone, that landed nearby when Superman defeated Arathaza, to conjure the whirling earth monster and send it rampaging towards Metropolis in order to seek vengeance on the living.\n\nThe Stranger realizes the stone is the source of power and manages to secure it, while back on Earth Superman has collected the &quot;tainted&quot; earth and carries it out to space and hurls it towards the sun, ending the threat.\n\nThanks goes to DobisP.R. for this release.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7935870/Action_Comics_584_(1987)_(DobisP.R.-Novus)_[NVS-D]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7935870/Action_Comics_584_(1987)_(DobisP.R.-Novus)_[NVS-D]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f620ce362593f7ec3ac0147d7113f19f163dce1","amp;dn":"Action+Comics+585+%281987%29+%28DobisP.R.-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f620ce362593f7ec3ac0147d7113f19f163dce1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,98,12,227,98,89,63,126,195,172,1,71,215,17,63,25,241,99,220,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
