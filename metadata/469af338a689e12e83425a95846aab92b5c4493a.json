Meet the Gallaghers. Mum went AWOL years ago, Dad stayed at home with the six children only to hit the bottle. And sometimes the kids... The real head of the family is big sister Fiona (20), who looks after Carl (11), Debbie (9) and baby Liam (3). She is occasionally helped, more often hindered, by reluctant virgin 'Lip' (16) and the actively gay, but very private, Ian (15).\n\nWelcome to a hectic world of sexual adventures, triumphs, love, scams and a fair bit of crime on a rough Manchester housing estate, where wheel-less cars are the norm and the moving ones are stolen.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:469af338a689e12e83425a95846aab92b5c4493a","amp;dn":"Shameless.S11E06.HDTV.x264-FoV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"469af338a689e12e83425a95846aab92b5c4493a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,154,243,56,166,137,225,46,131,66,90,149,132,106,171,146,181,196,73,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
