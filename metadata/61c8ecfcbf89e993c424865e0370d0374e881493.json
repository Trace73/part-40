It is still Mary Calmes though, and they are quick fun listens.\n\nTooth and Nail\nNarrated by: Andrew Schwartz\nLength: 2 hrs and 48 mins\nNineteen-year-old Dylan Shaw is possibly the most beautiful thing Malic Sunden has ever seen. After Malic rescues Dylan from an attack, Dylan makes it very clear that he is more than interested, but Malic wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even consider sleeping with Dylan because of his age. Malic is sure heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not good enough for Dylan, who has his whole life ahead of him, and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t conceive of burdening Dylan with his secrets. But the darkness in MalicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be denied, and soon Dylan is drawn into the dangerous paranormal world that is MalicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reality. \n\n\nSinnerman\nNarrated by: Andrew Schwartz\nLength: 2 hrs and 42 mins\nAs a warder, Jackson Tybalt is one of the good guys until he sees the man he loves kissing another. Betrayed and angry, Jackson tempts danger and death, ignoring the pleas of other warders to be careful. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a vile mood in which to start a romance, but that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop the kyrie Raphael, who more than anything wants Jackson for his very own. Jackson doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a hearth, he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want a lover - he just wants dark and painful, and Raphael will give him what he wants. \n\nNexus\nNarrated by: Paul Morey\nLength: 4 hrs and 1 min\nMarcus Roth is a top criminal lawyer by day and demon-slaying warder by night, but he is simply one of five wardersÃ¢â‚¬â€not really important to anyone but Joseph Locke, his hearth. Or so Marcus mistakenly believes. On a trip to Lexington, Kentucky, to celebrate JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grandfatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthday, that belief changes as Marcus unwittingly uncovers a paranormal dilemma and ends up revealing his identity as a warder to JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family. \n\nHis Hearth\nNarrated by: Andrew Schwartz\nLength: 2 hrs and 40 mins\nJulian Nash should be excited: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just earned a huge promotion at work and is going out to celebrate. But his happiness fades when he discovers his date cheating on him an hour before. Suddenly alone when everyone knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to have a plus one, Julian is set for a long night until longtime acquaintance Ryan Dean bails him out of the embarrassing situation. During dinner, they discover they have more than just friendship between them: there is mutual admiration and heated attraction. \n\nHeart in Hand\nNarrated by: Andrew Schwartz\nLength: 2 hrs and 36 mins\nSimon Kim is very much in love with Leith Haas, but Leith is a Warder. His job - hunting demons - is dangerous and important, and Simon doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to distract the man he loves more than life with the small stuff. But he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite get that when a Warder takes a Hearth, the Warder gives his heart without reservation. When Leith claimed Simon, Leith bared his soul, leaving himself vulnerable before the only man heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s certain heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll ever love. \n\n\nCherish Your Name\nNarrated by: Paul Morey\nLength: 3 hrs and 25 mins\nMalic Sunden is in hellÃ¢â‚¬â€only not literally... yet. As a warder, Malic is used to fighting demons and squaring off against all kinds of creatures from the pit, but this year heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s facing a new and terrifying prospect: Christmas holidays with his much-younger boyfriend and his family. He loves Dylan, his hearth, but DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parents, the Shaws, are another story. They think Malic is a cradle-robber, among other things. At least their neighbor, Brad, seems to like him.
