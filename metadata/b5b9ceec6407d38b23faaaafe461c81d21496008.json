Rhythm permeated this work at least on two levels: a disco/funk/house beat that propelled the track; and the pace at which snippets were glued together to form &quot;songs&quot;. At both levels the verve was palpable. The songs were gags, and each gag was an assembly of cells. It was entertaining, and it was terrifying. The whole recalled the grotesque and unpredictable merry-go-rounds of Frank Zappa's early works and the Residents' early suites. Vampire Rodents' &quot;lullaby land&quot; was set in a Freudian nightmare and that nightmare played at double speed in a very chaotic theater.\n\nAll Apple Lossless (ALAC)(average 850kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5b9ceec6407d38b23faaaafe461c81d21496008","amp;dn":"Vampire+Rodents+-+Lullaby+Land","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5b9ceec6407d38b23faaaafe461c81d21496008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,185,206,236,100,7,211,139,35,250,170,175,228,97,200,29,33,73,96,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
