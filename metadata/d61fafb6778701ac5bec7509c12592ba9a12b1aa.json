The project was initiated in 2002 by Bill Kendrick, who continues to maintain and improve the program, along with the help of several volunteers. \n\n\n\nIs licensed under the GNU General Public License and seen by many as a free alterative to proprietary software Kid Pix. \n\nHistory \n\n\n\nTux Paint was initially created for the Linux operating system, because there was no similar drawing application for children at this time. \n\n\n\nIt is written in C programming language and uses several helper libraries free. \n\n\n\nTux Paint is a drawing program designed for children, specifically for children between 3 and 12 who can make their first steps into the world of computer design. \n\nTux Paint includes a mascot named Tux, a penguin who will give advice and encouragement when children are half their creations. \n\nThe program includes an interface designed so that no child has problems when drawing whatever. \n\nOn one side we have the tools that allow us to create lines, paint, print drawings created, write text and much more. On the other hand we have the options of each of the tools.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d61fafb6778701ac5bec7509c12592ba9a12b1aa","amp;dn":"TuxPaint+2011++Team+Rjaa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d61fafb6778701ac5bec7509c12592ba9a12b1aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,31,175,182,119,135,1,172,91,236,117,9,193,37,146,186,154,18,177,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
