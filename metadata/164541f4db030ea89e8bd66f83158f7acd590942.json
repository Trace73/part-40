After the conclusion of the first set, Trey and Page carried a keyboard-shaped cake out to the front of the stage (with a giant two-dimensional mountain behind it, this created a tableau of the cover of Phish's Colorado '88 release), and proceeded to slice and serve cake in honor of their 30th anniversary to fans near the front of the stage. After the cake was served, a video was played showing Fishman collecting various props from the band's previous New Year's Eve concerts and driving a replica of the band's &quot;JEMP&quot; truck down to New York City. The truck from the video appeared in Madison Square Garden and was moved to the center of the floor. All of the songs played during both setbreaks were from the year 1983. The band performed the second set standing on top of the truck, using a stripped-down stage setup including hockey sticks for mic stands. During Grind, the &quot;days lived&quot; stated by the band referenced how old they would be when they returned for their 60th anniversary. During the encore break, a video montage of photographs and film from throughout Phish's history and previous New Year's Eve concerts was shown. After the encore, a video image was shown of a &quot;Save the Date&quot; card for Phish's 60th anniversary show (on December 31, 2043) with each band member digitally aged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164541f4db030ea89e8bd66f83158f7acd590942","amp;dn":"Phish+-+2013%2F12%2F28%2C29%2C30%2C31+-+Madison+Square+Garden%2C+New+York%2C+N","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164541f4db030ea89e8bd66f83158f7acd590942","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,69,65,244,219,3,14,168,158,139,214,111,131,21,143,122,205,89,9,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
