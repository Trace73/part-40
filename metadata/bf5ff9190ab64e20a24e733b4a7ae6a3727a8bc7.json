It was released in 1994). It is the first album in which John Linnell and John Flansburgh utilized a full band, as opposed to playing most or all of the instruments themselves. The album's name, a reference to the man vs. machine fable of John Henry, is roughly an allusion to the band's fundamental switch to more conventional instrumentation, especially the newly-established use of a human drummer instead of a drum machine.\n\nJohn Henry is both TMBG's longest record (twenty tracks clocking in at about a full hour) and their most divisive. However, it remains the band's highest-charting adult album, having peaked at #61 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLyrical themes\n\nThe lyrics to the song &quot;AKA Driver&quot; refer to a &quot;NyQuil driver&quot;. Legal issues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whether real or perceived ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ required a title with no reference to the medicine, and the lyrics to the song are omitted from the CD insert.\n\n&quot;I Should Be Allowed to Think&quot; excerpts the first line (I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving, hysterical) of the poem Howl by Allen Ginsberg.\n\n&quot;Meet James Ensor&quot; refers to an eccentric Belgian expressionist painter whose works excited John Flansburgh. In an interview, Flansburgh explained that &quot;the line 'Dig him up and shake his hand' is actually very specific ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a parallel idea to a lot of his paintings which involve resurrections, skeletons and puppets being animated. [...] With the song, I'm trying to encapsulate the issues of his life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an eccentric guy who became celebrated and was soon left behind as his ideas were taken into the culture and other people became expressionists.&quot;[1]\n\nThe song &quot;Subliminal&quot; contains a subliminal message at the end of the song saying &quot;Stare into the subliminal for as long as you can&quot; twice.\n\nTrack listing\n\n(All songs by They Might Be Giants unless otherwise noted)\n\n1.&quot;Subliminal&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n2.&quot;Snail Shell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:20\n3.&quot;Sleeping in the Flowers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n4.&quot;Unrelated Thing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n5.&quot;AKA Driver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:14 (They Might Be Giants, Tony Maimone, Brian Doherty)\n6.&quot;I Should Be Allowed to Think&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:09 (They Might Be Giants, Tony Maimone)\n7.&quot;Extra Savoir-Faire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n8.&quot;Why Must I Be Sad?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n9.&quot;Spy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:06\n10.&quot;O, Do Not Forsake Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n11.&quot;No One Knows My Plan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n12.&quot;Dirt Bike&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:05\n13.&quot;Destination Moon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:27\n14.&quot;A Self Called Nowhere&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n15.&quot;Meet James Ensor&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:33\n16.&quot;Thermostat&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n17.&quot;Window&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:00\n18.&quot;Out of Jail&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n19.&quot;Stomp Box&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n20.&quot;The End of the Tour&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:18\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Henry is the first album credited to They Might Be Giants as a full band, rather than a duo:\n\nBrian Doherty ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\nJohn Flansburgh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals, guitar\nJohn Linnell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals, keyboard, horns\nTony Maimone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\nGraham Maby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar\n\nGuests\n\nRobert Quine - guitar solos on &quot;Sleeping in the Flowers&quot; and &quot;No One Knows My Plan&quot;\nHudson Shad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals on &quot;O, Do Not Forsake Me&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf5ff9190ab64e20a24e733b4a7ae6a3727a8bc7","amp;dn":"They+Might+Be+Giants+%5B1994%5D+John+Henry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf5ff9190ab64e20a24e733b4a7ae6a3727a8bc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,95,249,25,10,182,78,32,162,78,115,59,74,122,230,163,114,122,139,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
