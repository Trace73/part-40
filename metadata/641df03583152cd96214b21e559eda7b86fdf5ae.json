A decade-long celebration of growth and power, fueled by the victory in WWII. Based on Pulitzer Prize winner David Halbertstam's bestselling book, this lively series casts a nostalgic eye back on the years of Ozzie and Harriet and the Hula Hoop, years which nonetheless paved the way for the tumult of the decades to follow. From Sputnik to Elvis, bobby-socks to the Kinsey Report, DAVID HALBERTSTAM'S THE FIFTIES is a breathtaking collage of the people, music, memories, fads and issues that sent the first Baby Boomers on their way. Countless interviews, clips from landmark TV shows and movies and specially-produced music videos set to original '50's hits capture the intense tapestry of optimism and fear, repression and discovery that was THE FIFTIES. \n\n\n\nEpisode 1 - The Fear And The Dream\n\nFollowing the victorious end of World War II, America was looking forward to new prosperity and relief from the shortages and rationing that the war required. New affluence, new low-cost suburban homes, and dreams of the good life resulted in a baby boom. With the advent of the Hydrogen bomb, a growing awareness of the communist threat and the beginning of the cold war, those dreams threatened to turn into nightmares.\n\n\n\nVideo \nVHSRip\nID : 0 \nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual \nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5 \nFormat settings, BVOP : 2 \nFormat settings, QPel : No \nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints \nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263) \nCodec ID : DX50 \nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 5 \nDuration : 1h 34mn \nBit rate : 2 721 Kbps \nWidth : 640 pixels \nHeight : 480 pixels \nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3 \nFrame rate : 29.970 fps \nColor space : YUV \nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0 \nBit depth : 8 bits \nScan type : Progressive \nCompression mode : Lossy \nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.296 \nStream size : 1.80 GiB (93%) \nWriting library : XviD 1.1.0 (UTC 2005-11-22) \n\nAudio \nID : 1 \nFormat : MPEG Audio \nFormat version : Version 1 \nFormat profile : Layer 3 \nMode : Joint stereo \nCodec ID : 55 \nCodec ID/Hint : MP3 \nDuration : 1h 34mn \nSource duration : 1h 34mn \nBit rate mode : Constant \nBit rate : 192 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels \nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz \nCompression mode : Lossy \nStream size : 130 MiB (7%) \nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves \nInterleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame) \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:641df03583152cd96214b21e559eda7b86fdf5ae","amp;dn":"History+Channel+-+David+Halberstam%27s+The+Fifties+%281997%29+-+Pt.+1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"641df03583152cd96214b21e559eda7b86fdf5ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,29,240,53,131,21,44,217,98,20,178,30,85,158,218,123,134,253,245,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
