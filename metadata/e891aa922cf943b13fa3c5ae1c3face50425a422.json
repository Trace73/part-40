In the game Derrick rampages around the globe munching on paper creatures and destroying everything he sees under the guise of avenging the death of his parents.\n\nAfter his parents are brutally turned into soup Derrick finds himself all alone in the deep blue sea...\n\nLuckily this gives him a flimsy pretext to destroy everything in his path in an orgy of rigid destruction! DerrickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quest takes him all around the globe, through 3 types of level, 4 different continents, 11 vibrant environments and 32 challenging levels. On the way Derrick must race against the clock and his own metabolism, collect diamonds, jump through flaming tyres in the sky, puzzle his way past manmade obstructions and duel to the death with oversized paper baddies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e891aa922cf943b13fa3c5ae1c3face50425a422","amp;dn":"Derrick+the+Deathfin+%5BENG%5D+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e891aa922cf943b13fa3c5ae1c3face50425a422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,145,170,146,44,249,67,177,63,163,197,174,28,63,172,229,4,37,164,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
