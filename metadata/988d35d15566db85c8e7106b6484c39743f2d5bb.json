The guitarists' nimble yet at times forceful approach is wholly evident during their highly rhythmic spin on &quot;Jingle Bells.&quot; They perform the classic &quot;Greensleeves&quot; with a sensitive, chamber-like approach while also tackling the Lennon/Ono favorite &quot;Happy X-Mas (War Is Over).&quot; However, part of the magic resides within the trio's ability to delve into the inherent frameworks of each song, while also reformulating themes and rhythms into personalized statements. Essentially, the artists have produced a rather poignant Christmas outing, awash with interweaving lines and lilting harmonies, as they complement their superior artisanship and forward-thinking deployments with a cheerfully rendered collection of holiday favorites.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:988d35d15566db85c8e7106b6484c39743f2d5bb","amp;dn":"California+Guitar+Trio+-+A+Christmas+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"988d35d15566db85c8e7106b6484c39743f2d5bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,141,53,209,85,102,219,133,200,231,16,107,100,132,195,151,67,242,213,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
