This volume contains Madonna's music videos from 1999 to 2009. The first disc contains all the music videos in high quality and english lyric subtitles, plus audio options to use the disc as a &quot;karaoke&quot;. The Extras contain as much as I was able to fit considering this decade had a ton of possible inclusions! The DVD focuses mostly on &quot;American Life&quot; as the most crucial moment, the first video ever pulled by Madonna for being too controversial during a very volatile moment in the world. Many interview extracts and specials explain Madonna's ideas behind the videos and they are discussed by experts. Some rare behind the footage material for several videos is included and of course the typical proper &quot;Making Of&quot; features. Disc 2 will have more of these long specials as they couldn't fit in this disc!. Thanks A LOT to madbritfan who helped me through this past year and Club78Boy who recently joined the project and generously shared more extras! They both sent the bulk of the files. Thanks also to the many people who contributed one way or another with pictures for their artwork, research, or single files etc! MUCH appreciated!  \n\n- TRACKLISTING -\n\n01 Beautiful Stranger\n02 American Pie\n03 Music\n04 Don't Tell Me\n05 What It Feels Like For A Girl\n06 Die Another Day\n07 American Life (Flags)\n08 American Life (Original Version)\n09 Hollywood\n10 Love Profusion\n11 Hung Up\n12 Sorry\n13 Get Together (Original)\n14 Jump\n15 Hey You\n16 4 Minutes\n17 Give It 2 Me\n18 Miles Away\n19 Celebration\n20 Celebration (Fans Version)\n\n- EXTRAS -\n\n01 Beautiful Stranger - Introduction by Madonna from TOTP\n02 Beautiful Stranger - Brett Ratner Director's Commentary\n03 American Pie - ET Behind The Scenes\n04 Music - Much Music Special Extract\n05 What It Feels Like For A Girl - E!
