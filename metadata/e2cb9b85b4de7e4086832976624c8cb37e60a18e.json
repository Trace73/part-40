The film's featured song, &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;, was performed by Joe Cocker.\nThe film follows the life of Carlito Brigante after he is released from prison and vows to go straight and retire in paradise. However, unable to escape his past, he ends up being dragged into the same criminal activities that got him imprisoned in the first place.\n\nIt received a mixed response from critics, with a similar lukewarm result at the box office, but has subsequently gained a cult following. Both Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller received Golden Globe nominations for their performances. A prequel titled Carlito's Way: Rise to Power, based on the first novel, was filmed and released in 2005.\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCarlitos Brigante, un antiguo traficante de heroÃƒÂ­na de origen portorriqueÃƒÂ±o, sale de la cÃƒÂ¡rcel despuÃƒÂ©s de cinco aÃƒÂ±os de reclusiÃƒÂ³n, dispuesto a dejar el trÃƒÂ¡fico de drogas.
