Ping Liu, Eric Fullerton, Oliver Gutfleisch, D.J. Sellmyer\n\nSpringer | 2009 | ISBN: 038785598X | 732 pages | PDF | 16,9 MB\n\n\n\nNanoscale Magnetic Materials and Applications covers exciting new developments in the field of advanced magnetic materials. Readers will find valuable reviews of the current experimental and theoretical work on novel magnetic structures, nanocomposite magnets, spintronic materials, domain structure and domain-wall motion, in addition to nanoparticles and patterned magnetic recording media.\n\nCutting-edge applications in the field are described by leading experts from academic and industrial communities. These include new devices based on domain wall motion, magnetic sensors derived from both giant and tunneling magnetoresistance, thin film devices in micro-electromechanical systems, and nanoparticle applications in biomedicine.\n\nIn addition to providing an introduction to the advances in magnetic materials and applications at the nanoscale, this volume also presents emerging materials and phenomena, such as magnetocaloric and ferromagnetic shape memory materials, which motivate future development in this exciting field.\n\nNanoscale Magnetic Materials and Applications also features a foreword written by Peter GrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nberg, recipient of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a7acb36ebc124d7b2e61f8dc7c31017cdd3c8b3","amp;dn":"Nanoscale+Magnetic+Materials+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a7acb36ebc124d7b2e61f8dc7c31017cdd3c8b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,122,203,54,235,193,36,215,178,230,31,141,199,195,16,23,205,211,200,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
