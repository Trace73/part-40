A quintet consisting of Joseph Marques on vocals, Michael Carlucci on guitar, Bob Perry on guitars and vocals, Bob Messing on bass, and Stanley Demeski on drums, the band built up a presence on college radio after opening for artists like the Bongos, the Godfathers, Let's Active, the Hoodoo Gurus, and Marshall Crenshaw. By the time they had signed with Link Records and issued their first EP, 1985's Churches, they had a new drummer, John Albanese. Four more EPs followed in 1986 on Link, Wait till the Morning, The Confessional, Leaving Time, and Say the Word (which featured another new drummer, Frank Fiannini). The same endless touring that helped build their fan base also brought them to the attention of Chrysalis Records, who signed the band and issued their self-titled LP in 1989. Their final personnel change came with that album, with yet another drummer, Dave Scheff. This lineup would release one last single in 1989, &quot;Roadside Flowers,&quot; before officially deciding to split two years later.\n\nWinter Hours - 1987 - Winter Hours &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Winter-Hours/release/2336414&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Winter-Hours/release/2336414&lt;/a&gt;\nTrack listing:\n01\t\t Hyacinth Girl\n02\t\t Waiting For The Thunder\n03\t\t We Can Only Win\n04\t\t All Along The Watchtower\n05\t\t Churches\n06\t\t Wait Till The Morning\n07\t\t The Confessional\n08\t\t September Street\n\n\nWinter Hours - 1989 - Wait Till The Morning &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Wait-Till-The-Morning/release/1668991&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Wait-Till-The-Morning/release/1668991&lt;/a&gt;\n1\t\t Hyacinth Girl\t4:36\t\n2\t\t Wait Till The Morning\t2:42\t\n3\t\t Simple John\t3:44\t\n4\t\t Island Of Jewels\t5:10\t\n5\t\t Incendiary\t2:47\t\n6\t\t Churches\t2:57\t\n7\t\t Walk Away\t4:17\t\n8\t\t At A Turtles Pace\t4:11\t\n9\t\t I Want\t2:35\t\n10\t\t All Along The Watch Tower\n\n\nWinter Hours - Ep 1986 - Wait Till The Morning &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Wait-Till-The-Morning/release/1534680&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/Winter-Hours-Wait-Till-The-Morning/release/1534680&lt;/a&gt;\n01               Hyacinth Girl\t\t\n02\t\t Wait Till The Morning\t\t\n03\t\t Simple John\t\t\n01\t\t Island Of Jewels\t\t\n02\t\t Incendiary\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d18d2f0638c50908b926de37793577e3586c14","amp;dn":"Winter+Hours++2+Compilations+1+EP++mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d18d2f0638c50908b926de37793577e3586c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,209,141,47,6,56,197,9,8,185,38,222,55,121,53,119,227,88,108,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
