Using previously overlooked documents from numerous archives, Abigail Adams shows that the wife of the second president of the United States was far more charismatic and influential than historians have realized. One of the finest writers of her age, Adams passionately campaigned for womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s education, denounced sex discrimination, and matched wits not only with her brilliant husband, John, but with Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. When male Patriots ignored her famous appeal to &quot;Remember the Ladies,&quot; she accomplished her own personal declaration of independence: Defying centuries of legislation that assigned married womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s property to their husbands, she amassed a fortune in her own name. AdamsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life story encapsulates the history of the founding era, for she defined herself in relation to the people she loved or hated (she was never neutral), a cast of characters that included her mother and sisters; Benjamin Franklin and James Lovell, her husbandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bawdy congressional colleagues; Phoebe Abdee, her fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former slave; her financially naÃƒÂ¯ve husband; and her son John Quincy.\n\nAt once epic and intimate, Abigail Adams, sheds light on a complicated, fascinating woman, one of the most beloved figures of American history.\n\n2010 Bancroft Prize Winner\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/abigail-adams-woody-holton/1100260528&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/abigail-adams-woody-holton/1100260528&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMeet the Author\nWoody Holton is an associate professor of history at the University of Richmond in Virginia and a former Guggenheim fellow.
