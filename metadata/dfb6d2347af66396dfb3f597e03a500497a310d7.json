The band later relocated from Adelaide to Sydney and enjoyed huge local success until well into the 1990s. For the purposes of international release, their records were released under the names Angel City and later The Angels From Angel City. From 2001 to 2007, the band's former members have toured and recorded under various names including Members of the Angels and The Original Angels Band.\n\n \nOrigin\n Adelaide, Australia \n\nGenres\n Hard rock, Australian pub rock \n\nYears active\n 1974 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2000, 2008 to present \n\n \nWebsite Official website \n\n\n\nMembers\n \nDoc Neeson\nJohn Brewster\nRick Brewster\nChris Bailey\nGraham &quot;Buzz&quot; Bidstrup \n\n\nFun Facts\n\nStarting when The Angels were a pub band their song &quot;Am I Ever Gonna See Your Face Again&quot; has received an iconic response from audiences. Whenever Doc Neeson sang the words of the Angels' classic love song 'Am I Ever Going to See Your Face Again?' back came the ingenious response: 'No way, get f**ked, f**k off'.[14]\n\nWhilst outside Australia this may have been seen as a negative response, from an Australian audience and in the context of the Australian sense of humour this was recognised as high praise.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfb6d2347af66396dfb3f597e03a500497a310d7","amp;dn":"The+Angels","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfb6d2347af66396dfb3f597e03a500497a310d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,182,210,52,122,246,99,150,223,179,245,151,224,58,80,4,151,163,16,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
