The Institute was the first to host the successful Bohus knitting exhibit in America, so it's fitting that their world-class textile collection provides the inspiration for these designs.\n \nAs in the authors' Norwegian Handknits, vintage photographs of Swedish immigrants, recipes, and photos of the artifacts that inspired the designs will be included, along with a short history of knitting in Sweden. Bohus, twined knitting, and Swedish mittens are some of the many techniques featured in the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5ec05c69f960dcb00987b36ae722532ee93313","amp;dn":"Swedish+Handknits%3A+A+Collection+Of+Heirloom+Designs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5ec05c69f960dcb00987b36ae722532ee93313","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,94,192,92,105,249,96,220,176,9,135,179,106,231,34,83,46,233,51,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
