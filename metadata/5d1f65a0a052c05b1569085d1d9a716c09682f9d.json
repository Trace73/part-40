If\n\nnot for the legendary heroics of International Fleet Commander Mazer Rackham, all \n\nwould have been lost. In preparation for the next attack, the highly esteemed Colonel \n\nGraff and the International Military are training only the best young children to \n\nfind the future Mazer. Ender Wiggin, a shy but strategically brilliant boy, is pulled \n\nout of his school to join the elite.\n\n\nArriving at Battle School, Ender quickly and easily masters increasingly difficult \n\nwar games, distinguishing himself and winning respect amongst his peers. Ender is \n\nsoon ordained by Graff as the military's next great hope, resulting in his promotion \n\nto Command School. Once there, he's trained by Mazer Rackham himself to lead his \n\nfellow soldiers into an epic battle that will determine the future of Earth and save \n\nthe human race.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d1f65a0a052c05b1569085d1d9a716c09682f9d","amp;dn":"Ender%27s+Game+by+Orson+Scott+Card","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d1f65a0a052c05b1569085d1d9a716c09682f9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,31,101,160,160,82,192,91,21,105,8,93,29,154,113,108,9,104,47,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
