Rangers.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4f60eb7abf3bd2a3d60aabd92be94495de93ed7","amp;dn":"VA_The+Art+Of+The+12%26quot%3B+Vol.+2_A+Promotion+Of+A+Way+Of+Life+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4f60eb7abf3bd2a3d60aabd92be94495de93ed7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,246,14,183,171,243,189,42,61,96,170,189,146,190,148,73,93,233,62,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
