Worried that she'll be left in the lurch by the unfaithful Montand, Bergman  enters into an affair with the much-younger Philip Van Der Besh (Anthony Perkins). Once he realizes that he's lost Paula to Philip, Roger offers to mend his rakish ways. She takes him back, and they are married; soon afterward, however, Roger goes back to his old skirt-chasing habits. Variety noted that Goodbye Again has &quot;strong appeal for a middle-aged distaff audience&quot;; nowadays, they'd call it a chick flick. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054936/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054936/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-54936/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-54936/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:55:12\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x448  1.61:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1235 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,16 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d615e300e69f3332cb48ccaa16dfb58b1fe99f26","amp;dn":"Goodbye+Again+%281961%29+Ingrid+Bergman+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d615e300e69f3332cb48ccaa16dfb58b1fe99f26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,21,227,0,230,159,51,50,203,72,204,170,22,223,181,139,31,233,159,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
