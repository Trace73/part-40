But mere mortals want them kept in their place. Enter a stunning world where technology and humanity clash in terrifying and surprising ways.\n\nSome people are implanted with upgrades that make them capable of superhuman feats. The powerful technology has profound consequences for society, and soon a set of laws is passed that restricts the abilitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and rightsÃ¢â‚¬â€of Ã¢â‚¬Å“amplifiedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ humans.\n\nOn the day that the Supreme Court passes the first of these laws, 29-year-old Owen Gray discovers that his seizure-supressing medical implant is actually a powerful upgrade. Owen joins the ranks of a new persecuted underclass known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“ampsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is forced to go on the run, desperate to reach an outpost in Oklahoma where, it is rumoured, a group of the most enhanced amps are about to change the worldÃ¢â‚¬â€or destroy it.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e8de8cefe1098472d275fcfd67bc5c5cd89aab","amp;dn":"Amped+A+Novel+by+Daniel+H.+Wilson+%28ePUB%2FMobi%29+%5BReq%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e8de8cefe1098472d275fcfd67bc5c5cd89aab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,232,222,140,239,225,9,132,114,210,117,252,253,103,188,92,92,216,154,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
