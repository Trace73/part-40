Now she is hunted by the Huhsz, a religious cult which believes that she is the last obstacle before the faith's apotheosis. Her only hope of escape is to find the last of the apocalyptically powerful Lazy Guns before the Huhsz find her. Her journey through the exotic Golterian system is a destructive and savage odyssey into her past, and that of her family and of the system itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Peter Kenny\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043fef985f10e58723b17cfc616b44979b1bbfd8","amp;dn":"Iain+M.+Banks+-+Against+a+Dark+Background","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043fef985f10e58723b17cfc616b44979b1bbfd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,63,239,152,95,16,229,135,35,177,124,252,97,107,68,151,155,27,191,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
