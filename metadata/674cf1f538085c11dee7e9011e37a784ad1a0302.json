This DLC added two new heists, additional weapons, and a new player upgrade tree.\nIn Payday: The Heist, players use a variety of firearms to complete objectives (usually centered around stealing a certain object or a particular amount of money). \nThe game plays from the first person perspective, but offers a few twists on the standard FPS formula. \nKilling civilians is frowned upon, meaning players have the option of restraining civilians until the heist concludes. \nShould any player die during the heist, one of his teammates may release a civilian in exchange for the player to respawn. \nEach heist is generated randomly, though it typically involves dealing with law enforcement, which can range from standard patrol officers to SWAT operatives......\n\nPC System Requirements:\n    OS: Windows XP, Vista, 7\n    Processor: Core 2 Duo or Athlon x2\n    Memory: 2 GB Ram\n    Video Card: NVIDIA 260 or ATI 4850 \n\n\nNOTES :\nThis version of game is already cracked - just install and play.\nMultiplayer - NOT working.\nGame version: 1.17.0\nDLC included:\n    The No Mercy heist\n    The Wolfpack \n\n\n\nHow to install:\nAfter download is done:\n- open (executable file) ,\n- choose location ,\n- click install ,\n- wait until is done \n- play game from desktop shortcut.\n\n\nMore info and support on\n\n\nIf you like this game torrent seed it to others.\nEnjoy .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:674cf1f538085c11dee7e9011e37a784ad1a0302","amp;dn":"Payday+The+Heist+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"674cf1f538085c11dee7e9011e37a784ad1a0302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,76,241,245,56,8,92,17,222,231,233,1,30,55,167,132,173,26,3,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
