In this polychromatic love child of Dr. Mario and Ikaruga, you battle a never-ending barrage of pills, pushing your skill and reflexes to the limit to avoid a lethal dosage.&quot;\n\nChangelog:\nv12.06.2014:\n- Special Levels start at level 10, not level 5!\n- Challenge Modes only unlock if YOU get to the level. Watching one show up in attract mode doesn't cut it anymore!\n- New players start with 5000mg\n- If you die, and then pause, there was a bug where pills would spawn anyway. That's been fixed. I think.\nv21.04.2014:\n- We've revamped the game's level progression, tweaked challenge mode difficulties, added a &quot;No Nonsense Mode&quot; (think more gameplay, fewer interruptions), added a sexy (and toggleable) new letterbox effect, and more!\n- New features, gameplay tweaks, and performance/bug fixes!\n- Minor update, fixing the issue with &quot;Points On The Board&quot; not unlocking. If you're on the scoreboard, it should unlock for you now! This fix is near and dear to me, because I tested it by clawing my way back onto the Top 20. Also, if any other achievents have been unlocked locally, they should automatically unlock now. If you guys have any other issues, please let us know in the forums!\n- Combo length achievements (Centurion, etc) unlock properly.\n- SOS achievement has been fixed.\n- Points on the Board achievement has been fixed.\n- Swing and a Miss achievement should unlock on steam, as well as in-game.\n- Heart Attack achievement text has been updated to be more clear.\n- King of the Will achievement has been updated to just beating a 30 million score.\n- Barbershop achievement has been fixed.\n- Lifetime achievements (Shifting Sands, etc) show their progress in Steam now.\n- If you play on a new computer, your cloud save should sync properly.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/237760/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/237760/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=intake&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=intake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=particlescolorsandlightcipherprimebundle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://isthereanydeal.com/#/page:game/price?plain=particlescolorsandlightcipherprimebundle&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1727461bb2d36a7650da454d3b57b80327fa96c4","amp;dn":"Intake+v12.06.2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1727461bb2d36a7650da454d3b57b80327fa96c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,39,70,27,178,211,106,118,80,218,69,77,59,87,184,3,39,250,150,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
