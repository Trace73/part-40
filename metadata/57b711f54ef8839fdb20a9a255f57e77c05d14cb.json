Upon reuniting with his unit's former Iraqi translator in New York City, he meets Amira (Dina Shihabi), his war buddy's niece; suspicious of soldiers, she wants nothing to do with him. However, when Amira runs into immigration trouble, Sam offers to keep her safe at his apartment. After a rocky start, their unlikely friendship starts to blossom into something more. Meanwhile, Sam's cousin Charlie (Paul Wesley) offers him a lucrative opportunity at his hedge fund, helping to secure wealthy veterans as new clients.
