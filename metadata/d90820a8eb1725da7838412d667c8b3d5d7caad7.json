Full of rich imagery, this page-turner will appeal to fans of suspense and fantasy. --Library Journal\n\nANYTHING BUT ORDINARY Kit Livingstone has led a terribly humdrum life. Even his girlfriend is dull. But soon all that changes when, with the help of his deceased great-grandfather, Kit is catapulted into worlds unknown in The Skin Map, the first book of the Bright Empires series by prolific writer Stephen R. Lawhead. Dynamic settings are mixed with unpredictable adventures as we follow Kit through his new life, which includes parallel worlds and time travel. Most interesting is the lost map many are battling to find, the map that is crucial to traveling the cosmos and, more importantly, getting back to Earth. And yes, it's tattooed on the mapmaker. But soon the reader discovers that, as intriguing as the map is, that's not the real prize. It's only square one. --BookPage --","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d90820a8eb1725da7838412d667c8b3d5d7caad7","amp;dn":"Stephen+R.+Lawhead+-+The+Skin+Map+%28NEW%21%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d90820a8eb1725da7838412d667c8b3d5d7caad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,8,32,168,235,23,37,218,120,56,65,45,102,124,139,61,93,124,170,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
