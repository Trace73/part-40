Haifan\nS.K. Kataria &amp; Sons | June 2011 | ISBN 978-7-114-08864-3 | ePUB | 14.9 mb\n\n2007 onwards, Bridge Engineering at Tongji University decided to open a new course\n Ã¢â‚¬Å“Concept Bridge DesignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for graduate students in order to bring forward a new generation\n of bridge engineers with conceptual design capabilities to overcome the shortcoming\n in innovative ideas quality and aesthetic considerations in ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bridge engineering.\nThe course started in the Spring of 2008, first in the form of lectures given by\n several young professor in the division. 2008 summer, Professor Hoi Fan also joined\n the ranks of the course construction, participated in determining the teaching guideline,\n and co-authored with Professor Xiao Rucheng\n\nWe hope that the publication of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the\n concept of bridge designÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ can bring inspiration and encouragement to Chinese students\n majoring in bridges sector as well as colleagues to overcome the deficiencies in\n ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bridge design, to come out of misunderstanding, and to help the education\n of bridge engineering in Chinese Universities rid of the shackles of traditional\n materials and methods and to keep up with the international engineering education\n reform. We welcome all feedbacks, especially to the errors in the book, from colleagues\n bridge engineering for future amendment in the second edition in order to further\n improve this Ã¢â‚¬Å“Conceptual Bridge DesignÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and make it a compulsory textbooks for 21st\n century bridge engineers. \n\nCONTENTS\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Introduction\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Aesthetic Bridge Design\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Basic Factors to be Considered in the Conceptual Design\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Case Analysis of Innovative Ideas in the Conceptual Design\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Disaster Prevention and Durability of Bridge Structures\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Bridge Structure System and Key Mechanics Questions\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Solving New Problem in the Conceptual Design\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Conceptual Design of Urban Bridge.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/ias6ausb9/Conceptual_Design_of_Bridges.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/ias6ausb9/Conceptual_Design_of_Bridges.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6416ed2e332c724d0e7db4c45209931aab7681d","amp;dn":"Conceptual+Design+of+Bridges+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6416ed2e332c724d0e7db4c45209931aab7681d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,65,110,210,227,50,199,36,208,231,219,76,69,32,153,49,170,183,104,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
