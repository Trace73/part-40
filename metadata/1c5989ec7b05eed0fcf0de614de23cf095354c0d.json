All of this music is rare and had to be painstakingly converted from LPs and cassette tapes. Georgia-native Pat Terry and The Pat Terry Group are often-overlooked pioneers of early contemporary Christian music during the 70's Jesus movement and into the 80's.\n\nEncoding: MPEG1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nBitrate:  192 kbps CBR\nMode:     mixed (stereo + joint stereo)\n\nOne folder contains Pat Terry's solo albums, the other contains The Pat Terry Group's.  JPEG album covers are included in each album's folder.\n\nNOTE that one song (track 9 on Final Vinyl) is not 192 kbps, but rather ~160 kbps VBR. Trust me that it sounds better in every way than the 192 kbps CBR version I once had of that song.\n\nMost of these albums are rare in any decent condition, and my collection is the result of 10 years of research and conversion. The tracks that are in joint stereo on some of the 70's albums are available in stereo on this copy of the 1980 Best Of album, which is why I have included it.\n\nALBUM &amp; TRACK LISTING\n---------------------\nPat Terry by Pat Terry (1974) - joint stereo\n 1.
