They work hard, they tour and practice, but they play because they want to. They're pretty inspiring.\n\nThe band is made up of two sisters. Chloe plays drums and Asya plays keyboard and sings. They've toured North America and Europe with Jimmy Eat World, The Go! Team, and Mates of State, and they've played around the U.S. with Rilo Kiley, Pearl Jam, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens, Sleater-Kinney, and Cat Power (the latter of whom paid tribute to Smoosh by including a lip-sync performance of one of their songs in her live set). They were featured on the Today Show and NPR's All Things Considered, and were nominated for SpinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2005 &quot;Band of the Year.&quot; Other than the worldwide touring during school breaks, they're basically normal girls with normal lives.\n\n   1. &quot;Massive Cure&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59\n   2. &quot;It's Cold&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n   3. &quot;It's Not Your Day to Shine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:04\n   4. &quot;Rad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:51\n   5. &quot;Take It Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n   6. &quot;La Pump&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n   7. &quot;Pygmy Motorcycle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:40\n   8. &quot;About the Picture&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:08\n   9. &quot;Bottlenose&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n  10. &quot;Make It Through&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:11\n  11. &quot;I've Got My Own Problems to Fix&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:14\n  12. &quot;The Quack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:49\n  13. &quot;To Walk Away From&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:18\n  14. &quot;But Now I Know&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:11\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6507d87cf93dcc13a3940d8a7c18e832ca5befa","amp;dn":"Smoosh+-+She+like+Electric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6507d87cf93dcc13a3940d8a7c18e832ca5befa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,80,125,135,207,147,220,193,58,57,64,216,167,193,142,131,44,165,190,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
