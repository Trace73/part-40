Not only does the album's theme evolve around the mystique of the pyramid, but it also touches on man's fascination with superstition and its powers. The instrumental &quot;Voyager&quot; opens things up, and its provocative style sets the tone for the album's supernatural mood. The bright-sounding &quot;What Goes Up&quot; is one of the highlights here, as is &quot;The Eagle Will Rise Again,&quot; sung by Colin Blunstone. The anxiety-ridden &quot;Pyramania&quot; enhances the album's concept the best, accompanied by some excitable keyboard playing and a friendly middle. The lesson-learning &quot;Can't Take It with You&quot; teaches that our souls are our most important asset, in typical Parsons-type charm. While not a stellar album, Pyramid completes the task of musically explaining its concept. Its short but slightly compelling nature grows after a few listens, but the album itself isn't a necessity. allmusicguide\n\nTechnical Information:\n\nWashed LP&gt;\nAT120E&gt;\nDual CS 505-3&gt;\nKenwood C1&gt;\nGold platted Cable&gt;\nEdirol R09HR @ 24/96&gt;\nSandisc Extreme III SDHC Card&gt;\nHDD\n\nWavelab 5\nClickRepair 3/0 (manual mode)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb2733d98e2f97821e91f5836ebc9b4700adc0d","amp;dn":"The+Alan+Parsons+Project+1978+Pyramid+%28Vynil+Rip+24%2F192000%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb2733d98e2f97821e91f5836ebc9b4700adc0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,178,115,61,152,226,249,120,33,233,31,88,54,235,201,180,112,10,220,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
