It was the title track from the 1984 album of the same name, which in turn was the soundtrack album for the 1984 film of the same name, and was released as the third single from that album. The song is an emotional combination of rock and roll, pop and gospel music. It reached #2 in the U.S., and is widely considered as one of Prince's signature songs.\n\n    The song was recorded live at the Minneapolis club First Avenue in 1983. The performance was the live debut of Wendy Melvoin, and also netted the final three songs of the Purple Rain album, although the songs would undergo studio overdubs later. &quot;Purple Rain&quot;'s original lyrics contained an extra verse about money, which was edited out, as it diluted the emotional impact of the song.\n\n\n   In March 2005, Q magazine placed it at number 40 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. Rolling Stone ranked it #143 on their list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.(It is a favorite song of Eric Clapton).\n\n\n                             ***Purple Rain.***\n\n                                   Enjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cfd9a59e36bede7534d9647b2a05dc021f6cbcc","amp;dn":"Prince+%26+The+Revolution-Purple+Rain%281984%29%28Full%26Clean%29-Wushan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cfd9a59e36bede7534d9647b2a05dc021f6cbcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,253,154,89,227,107,237,231,83,77,150,71,178,160,93,192,33,246,203,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
