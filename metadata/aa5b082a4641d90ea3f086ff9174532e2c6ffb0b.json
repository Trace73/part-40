The trio hit it off, but it would take a decade for them to collaborate. In 2010, they reunited in Seattle, where Ament invited Arthur to his Montana studio. Two years later, in April 2012, the group dubbed RNDM recorded an album in four days. Acts was released in October that year. It featured a familiar '90s alt-rock sound, laying Arthur's gravelly voice over Ament and Stuverud's rollicking bass and drums. Four years later, the band returned with a sophomore effort. Updating their sound with slinky rhythms and dance beats, RNDM debuted their new sonic direction on first single &quot;NYC Freaks.&quot; Ghost Riding was released a month later in March 2016.\r\n\r\n\r\nMP3 320Kbps\r\n\r\n\r\nActs (2012)\r\n-----------------\r\n01-Modern Times\r\n02-Darkness\r\n03-The Disappearing Ones\r\n04-What You Can't Control\r\n05-Hollow Girl\r\n06-Walking Through New York\r\n07-Look Out!\r\n08-New Tracks\r\n09-Throw You to the Pack\r\n10-Williamsburg\r\n11-Letting Go of Will\r\n12-Cherries in the Snow\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nGhost Riding (2016)\r\n---------------------\r\n01-Stumbling Down\r\n02-Comfortable\r\n03-Ghost Riding\r\n04-Got To Survive\r\n05-Stray\r\n06-Stronger Man\r\n07-Trouble\r\n08-NYC Freeks\r\n09-Kingdom In The Sky\r\n10-It's Violence\r\n11-Dream Your Life Away\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa5b082a4641d90ea3f086ff9174532e2c6ffb0b","amp;dn":"RNDM+-+Acts+%282012%29+%2B+Ghost+Riding+%282016%29+by+titler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa5b082a4641d90ea3f086ff9174532e2c6ffb0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,91,8,42,70,65,217,14,163,240,134,255,145,116,83,46,44,111,251,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
