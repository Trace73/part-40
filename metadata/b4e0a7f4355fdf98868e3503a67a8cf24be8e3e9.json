Chapters cover geography, history, people and culture, government and politics, the economy, and possibilities for the future. The text is dense and presented in very long sentences and paragraphs, so even though the book is small and might appeal to younger readers, the narrative will probably work best for the older end of the age range. The book also includes several elements to help students doing research, including a list of pertinent facts, history highlights, a bibliography, suggestions for further reading and research, and a detailed index.\n\nFor More...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ditchers.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ditchers.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e0a7f4355fdf98868e3503a67a8cf24be8e3e9","amp;dn":"United+States+of+America+%28Modern+World+Nations%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e0a7f4355fdf98868e3503a67a8cf24be8e3e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,224,167,244,53,95,223,152,134,142,53,3,166,122,140,242,75,232,227,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
