Key topics include seed germination, crop emergence, crop establishment, dormancy, preharvest sprouting, plant hormones, abscisic and giberellic acids, weeds, grain quality, oil crops, and malting quality. Abundant case studies provide information of value to researchers, students, and professionals in the fields of seed science, field crop research, crop science, agronomy, and seed technology.\n\nThe Handbook of Seed Physiology discusses vital topics which serve as the basis for the development of techniques and processes to improve seed performance and crop yield. In this text, you will explore:\n\n- the effect of the soil physical environment on seed germination\n- the roles of physiology, genetics, and environment in the inception, maintenance, and termination of dormancy\n- the relationship between the termination of dormancy and the synthesis and signaling of gibberellins and abscisic acid\n- mechanisms of orthodox seed deterioration and approaches for repair of seed damage\n- characteristics, behavior, and mechanisms of desiccation tolerance in recalcitrant seeds\n- the role of seed moisture in free radical assaults on seeds and the protective function of raffinose oligosaccharides\n- the production of free radicals and their effect on lipids and lipid peroxidation\n- components of grain quality in oil crops and factors influencing them\n- structural components and genotypic and environmental factors affecting barley malting quality\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00165082470ac6b7b326316513c8c67e58b3f40d","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Seed+Physiology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00165082470ac6b7b326316513c8c67e58b3f40d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,22,80,130,71,10,198,183,179,38,49,101,19,200,198,126,88,179,244,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
