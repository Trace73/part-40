Wellman and written by Maude Fulton. \nIt was produced and distributed by Warner Brothers. The film stars Grant Withers, Regis Toomey and Mary Astor. \nThe film was first previewed and released in a limited number of locations under the title The Steel Highway in 1930. \nBy the time of the film's general release the title had been changed to Other Men's Women. \nDue to the public's apathy and aversion to anything musical in films in late 1930 and early 1931, the film's music is kept to an absolute minimum. \nThe credits at the beginning and ending of the film are presented without music and there is virtually no background musical score throughout the film.\n\nCAST:-\nGrant Withers as Bill White\nMary Astor as Lily Kulper\nRegis Toomey as Jack Kulper\nJames Cagney as Ed 'Eddie' Bailey\nJoan Blondell as Marie\nFred Kohler as Haley\nJ.
