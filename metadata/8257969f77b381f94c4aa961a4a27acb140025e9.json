Haunted is a tough act to follow, being perhaps Herbert's most effective novel, a concise and unsettling ghost story built around a major plot twist. Following the cynical Ash's confrontation with the supernatural in Haunted, there's no real mileage to be had out of the characters 'are they real, are they fake?' debunking of ghosts, so Herbert instead takes the traditional sequel route, with The Ghosts of Sleath expanding the action, so now instead of a haunted house we have an entire haunted village.\n\n\n                             Format 1 - Epub\n\n                             Format 2 - Mobi\n\n\n\n             **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8257969f77b381f94c4aa961a4a27acb140025e9","amp;dn":"The+Ghosts+of+Sleath+by+James+Herbert+%28David+Ash+Book+2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8257969f77b381f94c4aa961a4a27acb140025e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,87,150,159,119,179,129,249,76,74,169,97,164,162,122,203,20,0,37,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
