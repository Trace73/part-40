RAR files can usually compress content by 8 percent to 15 percent more than ZIP files can. WinRAR&amp;#039;s main features include strong general and multimedia compression, the ability to process non-RAR archive formats, ZIP compression and decompression, support for long filenames, programmable self-extracting archives (SFX), repair of damaged archives, authenticity verification, embedded file comments, and encryption. Unicode is supported in archive filenames, allowing non-English filenames to be handled painlessly. You can manipulate the parameters of many archives at once and view a volume sequence as a single archive. WinRAR can convert other archive formats to RAR and search for specified text and files in archives.\n\n\nPLEASE REMBER TO SEED!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:957351d6b884ec3fd945d23c3ff6b51d74e6db0b","amp;dn":"Winrar+Full+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"957351d6b884ec3fd945d23c3ff6b51d74e6db0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,115,81,214,184,132,236,63,217,69,210,60,63,246,181,29,116,230,219,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
