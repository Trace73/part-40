This concise book takes you beyond the network layer and helps you explore the issues you need to address if you are to successfully migrate your apps to IPv6. It's ideal for application developers, system/network architects, product managers, and others involved in moving your network to IPv6.\nExplore changes you need to make in your application's user interface \nMake sure your application is retrieving correct information from DNS \nEvaluate your appÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ability to store and process both IPv6 and IPv4 addresses \nDetermine if your app exposes or consumes APIs where there are IP address format dependencies \nWork with the network layer to ensure the transport of messages to and from your app \nIncorporate IPv6 testing into your plans, and use the correct IPv6 addresses in your documentation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b90eb01b90e2b9c6d7ab833da8577dbc6300f334","amp;dn":"Migrating+Applications+to+IPv6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b90eb01b90e2b9c6d7ab833da8577dbc6300f334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,14,176,27,144,226,185,198,215,171,131,61,168,87,125,188,99,0,243,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
