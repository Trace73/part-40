John and Reagan make a fateful trip on horseback through the dense Tennessee forest to the nearest city for desperately-needed supplies. However, this will prove more dangerous than they could have ever anticipated, and they quickly learn just how far humanity has plummeted into a well of darkness and despair. And Reagan will discover just how far John will go to keep her safe. \n\nThe familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own humanity is tested as they aid those less fortunate from lawless hordes that are raping, robbing and murdering anyone who gets in their way. Just when KellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s demons seem to be quieting, a new threat ascends the farm, one that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t simply frighten off with suppressive fire. \n\nThe tough-as nails Army Rangers living on the farm will do whatever it takes to keep this family safe and hold onto the McClane compound at any cost. Fraught with human emotion, complex relationships, and the continued fight for survival, book two takes the reader on a thrill ride that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let up- not even after the last page has been turned. \n\nLook for the final installment The McClane Apocalypse, Book Three out fall 2014. \n\n\n\nGenre: Horror | Science Fiction\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8d19b0b9620abf8e852538432173ce90f75f655","amp;dn":"Kate+Morris+-+The+McClane+Apocalypse+%28Book+Two%29+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8d19b0b9620abf8e852538432173ce90f75f655","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,209,155,11,150,32,171,248,232,82,83,132,50,23,60,233,15,117,246,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
