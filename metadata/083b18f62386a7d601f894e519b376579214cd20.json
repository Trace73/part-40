Parker still favors a clean tone, thoughtful\nnote choices over flash at every turn, and a cooperative aesthetic with his\nbandmates (Parker had his hand in writing only three of eight tracks). The main\ndifferences are the addition of Sam Barsheshet on Fender Rhodes and Wurlitzer,\nand a more &quot;song-oriented&quot; approach that casts Parker's playing in a new\nlight. There's less of a bebop flavor, although his playing is just as\nharmonically rich, and these songs are much more likely to stick in your head\nthan the slightly more abstract songs on Like-Coping. And the only time they\neven approach the intensity of the two collective improvisations from\nLike-Coping is on the intro to the final tune. They even cover Marvin Gaye!\n&quot;Istanbul&quot; is Chad Taylor's only contribution, a pretty tune with some acoustic\nguitar and excellent brushwork from Taylor. &quot;Mannerisms&quot; (which bears some\nresemblance to &quot;Spanish Key&quot; by Miles Davis) picks up the pace with an\ninsistent groove and some great Rhodes work from Barsheshet. Parker's soloing\nis unhurried and very melodic, with just enough twists and turns to keep things\nconstantly interesting. This approach becomes really evident on &quot;When Did You\nStop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You,&quot; where Parker's note choices add a\nconsiderable knottiness to the Marvin Gaye tune. His take on &quot;The Relative&quot;\n(originally written for Isotope 217) has a great polyrhythmic groove and a cool\nphased treatment over the top, and bassist Chris Lopes adds some tasty flute to\nhis tune &quot;Beanstalk.&quot; &quot;Rang&quot; is the only track to disrupt the easygoing vibe\nwith a slightly ominous intro before settling into a more gentle groove, even\nas Chad Taylor whips up an Elvin Jones-style quiet storm behind them. These\nguys are not just great players, they're great listeners, and The Relatives\nperfectly balances the gentle and tuneful with the added spark of the band's\ncollective improvisational skills. The sound is more approachable than his\nother albums, but no less interesting. This is a real winner.\n\n--\n\nBy Matthew Wuethrich &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2138&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2138&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Rex Butters &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-relatives-jeff-parker-thrill-jockey-review-by-rex-butters.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/the-relatives-jeff-parker-thrill-jockey-review-by-rex-butters.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Tim O'Neil &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/review/parkerjeff-relatives/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.popmatters.com/review/parkerjeff-relatives/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPor Manel (es)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083b18f62386a7d601f894e519b376579214cd20","amp;dn":"Jeff+Parker+-+The+Relatives+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083b18f62386a7d601f894e519b376579214cd20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,59,24,246,35,134,167,214,1,248,148,229,25,179,118,87,146,20,205,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
