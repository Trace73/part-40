(Except for the special that i did)\n\nThis is simply a re-encode of all episode for people who have not enough HDD space. That mean smaller files with good quality because of the slow encode.\n\nFormat : BD 720p\nAudio : Japanese\nSubs : English (All credits goes to the team that did them, their names will be on the file name.)\n\nInfos available on the site.\n\nOVA\n- Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn (OVA 1-7).\nSPECIAL\n- 100 Years of Solitude. I use the official subtitles that i modified a little, nothing great, re-style and of course re-encode. Thanks to [Kita] who rip it from the BDMV. This is a recap of Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ and Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack focusing on Newtype and Zeonism ideals told before UC episode 7. It was include as a bonus with the last OVA.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0682571bca184e4ed8b953dcca86a4e956dca8","amp;dn":"Mobile+Suit+Gundam+Unicorn+%28BD+720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0682571bca184e4ed8b953dcca86a4e956dca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,6,130,87,27,202,24,78,78,216,185,83,220,202,134,164,233,86,220,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
