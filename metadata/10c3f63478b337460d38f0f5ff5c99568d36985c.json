The group consists of five core members: Mads Brauer, Casper Clausen, Thomas Husmer, Rune MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸lgaard and Rasmus Stolberg. When performing live, the core five-piece band is complemented with the addition of violinist/singer Peter Broderick, trombonist/singer Niklas Antonson, pianist/singer Anna BrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸nsted and guitarist/singer Frederik Teige.\n\nThey have released albums on the British/American record label The Leaf Label, but also have their own record label called Rumraket (the Danish word for space rocket). So far the Rumraket roster includes Grizzly Bear, amiina, Cacoy, Erik Levander, Kama Aina, Slaraffenland, Taxi Taxi!, and Canon Blue.\n\nEfterklang has a history of working with many guest musicians on their recordings. Filmmaker Karim Ghahwagi can also be found among their key contributors, having made several visuals for their live shows from 2003 to 2005 as well as the video for &quot;Swarming.&quot; Another key contributor is Nan Na Hvass, the mastermind behind the critically acclaimed artwork for One-Sided LP, Under Giant Trees, Parades, and the Mirador video (Oct. 2007)\n\nLive from Mejeriet, Lund, Sweden 2008.\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2009 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10c3f63478b337460d38f0f5ff5c99568d36985c","amp;dn":"Efterklang+-+Frida+Found+A+Friend+%28Live+Lund+2008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10c3f63478b337460d38f0f5ff5c99568d36985c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,195,246,52,120,179,55,70,13,56,240,245,255,92,153,86,141,54,152,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
