In three decades in Hollywood, Kirstie Alley has lived with, worked with, loved, or lost all of these men, and in this revealing memoir, she peels back the layers (and sometimes the sheets) on her relationships with all of them.\n\nFrom the early days of her childhood in Wichita, Kansas, surrounded by her loving father, her inquisitive and doting grandfather, and a younger brother she fiercely protected when she wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t selling tickets to see him naked, Kirstie AlleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life has been shaped and molded by men. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Men, men, glorious men!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ gave her her first big break in Hollywood and her awardwinning role on Cheers, and through two marriages, a debilitating cocaine addiction, the death of her mother, roles in some of the biggest comedies of the last twenty years, and a surprising stint on Dancing with the Stars, men proved to be the inspiration for multitudes of the decisions and dramas in Kirstie AlleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life.\n\nIn this collection of linked essays thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both hilarious and poignant in turns, Kirstie chronicles all the good, the bad, and the ugly men who have influenced and guided her. She demonstrates how men can be the air that women breathe or the source of all of their frustrations. But for better or worse, Kirstie shows that a life well lived is a life lived in the company of men, especially if they remember to put the lid down. The Art of Men (I Prefer Mine al Dente) is a hilarious excursion into love, joy, motherhood, loss, sex, and self-discovery from one of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most enduring stars.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74022c401a5ca89cac4b84931031b58eabb451fd","amp;dn":"Kirstie+Alley+%282012%29.+The+Art+of+Men+%28I+Prefer+Mine+al+Dente%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74022c401a5ca89cac4b84931031b58eabb451fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,2,44,64,26,92,168,156,172,75,132,147,16,49,181,142,171,180,81,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
