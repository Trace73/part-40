The band delivers dark and bitter-sweet melodies and beats, swathed in distorted guitars and Anne Lise FrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¸kedal's unique and enthralling voice.\n\nTogether they create organic electronic synthpop-poetry, which melts into the conscious musical nerve centre. Harrys Gym is strict and calculated in one moment, dream-like poetic liquid in the next. Songs that embrace the magic moments of Blonde Redhead and The Knife's mutual caress - with an indeterminable insisting presence, even after the last tone has faded out.\n\nNME ranked Harrys Gym's concert at by:Larm amongst the festival's top five, with Drowned in Sound nodding in agreement, describing it as &quot;a bruising, sonic squall of an affair. Dramatic, dark pop is the order of the day, equal parts delicate and muscular.&quot;\n\nThe song &quot;Whisper&quot; is featured on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Fritt Vilt II&quot; (premiere October 10th).\n\nAttic (12&quot;), with a remix from diskJokke and Kjetil Ovesen (120 days), is out now. The self-titled debut album &quot;Harrys Gym&quot; is released on Monday 27th of October on Hype City, and is distributed by VME.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909f72c4a62e6e88915d2aef173941054d6eb256","amp;dn":"Harrys+Gym+-+Harrys+Gym+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909f72c4a62e6e88915d2aef173941054d6eb256","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,159,114,196,166,46,110,136,145,93,42,239,23,57,65,5,77,110,178,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
