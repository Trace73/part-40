Itâ€™s probably for the best that Warhammer Quest doesnâ€™t try.\r\n\r\nWarhammer Quest doesnâ€™t revolutionize the dungeon crawler. Any gamer who hasnâ€™t Rip Van Winkled through the last couple of decades has delved more virtual dungeons than have ever actually existed in history. Thereâ€™s little in this game that you havenâ€™t seen elsewhere, but youâ€™ve rarely seen that stuff assembled into such an elegant, sophisticated package.\r\n\r\nWarhammer Quest doesnâ€™t revolutionize the dungeon crawler â€” it elevates it.\r\n\r\n 6 additional Heroes\r\n Fight the Skaven in a huge expansion\r\n 40+ hours of gameplay (including expansions)\r\n Whispersync game saves\r\n GameCircle achievements\r\n\r\nWhat's in this version : (Updated : Nov 6, 2015)\r\n\r\n Support for Nexus5X added\r\n\r\nMod Info:\r\nThe game is fully purchased\r\n\r\nRequired Android O/S : 4.0+\r\nInstall APK,Place data folder in SDCard/Android/Obb/ and play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:659fc698dc80f2c987c6220794a1dbe4183e3789","amp;dn":"Warhammer+Quest+v1.1.5+Unlocked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"659fc698dc80f2c987c6220794a1dbe4183e3789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,159,198,152,220,128,242,201,135,198,34,7,148,161,219,228,24,62,55,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
