The song was released in 1989 and written by bandmates Rachel Bolan and Dave &quot;the Snake&quot; Sabo. It is about a young man and the hard life he goes through.\n\nThe song was to be the band&amp;#039;s biggest hit, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100, but only reaching #11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, which was previously their biggest market.\n\nThis song also appears on Skid Row&amp;#039;s greatest hits compilation, 40 Seasons: The Best of Skid Row. Lead singer of Skid Row, Sebastian Bach, released a live version of this on his solo album Bring &amp;#039;Em Bach Alive!. It is also a playable song on the video game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s.\n\nSkid Row guitarist Dave &quot;Snake&quot; Sabo wrote this song after reading in a local newspaper about an 18-year-old boy who shot his friend by accident. He thought the gun wasn&amp;#039;t loaded, and eventually ended up in prison for life.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d947c7cb59c9d85ddad26424b80fc8667c90d81","amp;dn":"Skid+Row+-+18+And+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d947c7cb59c9d85ddad26424b80fc8667c90d81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,148,124,124,181,156,157,133,221,173,38,66,75,128,252,134,103,201,13,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
