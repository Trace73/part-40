In the course of unpacking some of her own storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€of her mother and her decline from memory loss, of a trip to Iceland, of an illnessÃ¢â‚¬â€Solnit revisits fairytales and entertains other stories: about arctic explorers, Che Guevara among the leper colonies, and Mary ShelleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dr. Frankenstein, about warmth and coldness, pain and kindness, decay and transformation, making art and making self. Woven together, these stories create a map which charts the boundaries and territories of storytelling, reframing who each of us is and how we might tell our story.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:082b30b786ee408d7ccc7238fc9cf911051a3329","amp;dn":"The+Faraway+Nearby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"082b30b786ee408d7ccc7238fc9cf911051a3329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,43,48,183,134,238,64,141,124,204,114,56,252,156,249,17,5,26,51,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
