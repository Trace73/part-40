It is a signal contribution to our knowledge of Egyptian Christianity in the third and fourth centuries.Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ¹\nÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®Birger Pearson, Institute for Antiquity and Christianity\n\nSamuel Rubenson, by means of a fresh analysis of the letters of St. Antony, exposes the distortion of the picture of early Christian monks as unlettered and primitive. Rubenson describes the desert monasteries as centers of theological reflection in Egypt, showing how they combined the speculative philosophy of the Greeks and the biblical tradition. Included in this volume is a new translation of the letters themselves, which are shown to be authentic and an important source for the study of the desert fathers and the early monastic tradition. The later image of Antony is demonstrated to be influenced by church politics of the latter part of the fourth century. \n\nSamuel Rubenson is Associate Professor at Lund University, Lund, Sweden","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04a733f4ef4f421be4004338f57aad12b8a2dfb8","amp;dn":"Letters+of+St.+Antony+-+Monasticism+and+the+Making+of+A+Saint+%282","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04a733f4ef4f421be4004338f57aad12b8a2dfb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,167,51,244,239,79,66,27,228,0,67,56,245,122,173,18,184,162,223,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
