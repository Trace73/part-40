In the past, similar ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œanomaliesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ have revolutionized our world, like in the sixteenth century, when a set of celestial anomalies led Copernicus to realize that the earth goes around the sun and not the reverse, and in the 1770ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, when two chemists discovered oxygen because of experimental results that defied the theories of the day. Thus, if history is any precedent, we should look to todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inexplicable results to forecast the future of science.\n\nIn 13 Things That DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Make Sense, Michael Brooks heads to the scientific frontier to meet thirteen modern-day anomalies and discover tomorrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s breakthroughs.\n\nMichael Brooks, Ph.D., is a consultant and former senior features editor for New Scientist, where the wildly popular articles on which this book is based first appeared. He has written for the Guardian, the Independent, and the Observer and lives in England.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:834a86fbe196a4f018640ee886cc2ee70a52aae6","amp;dn":"Michael+Brooks-13+Things+That+Don%5C%27t+Make+Sense","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"834a86fbe196a4f018640ee886cc2ee70a52aae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,74,134,251,225,150,164,240,24,100,14,232,134,204,46,231,10,82,170,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
