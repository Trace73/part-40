This companion to the landmark PBS miniseries vividly and candidly tells how the story of Latino Americans is the story of our country.\n\nAuthor and acclaimed journalist Ray Suarez explores the lives of Latino American men and women over a five-hundred-year span, encompassing an epic range of experiences from the early European settlements to Manifest Destiny; the Wild West to the Cold War; the Great Depression to globalization; and the Spanish-American War to the civil rights movement.\n\nLatino Americans shares the personal struggles and successes of immigrants, poets, soldiers, and many othersÃ¢â‚¬â€individuals who have made an impact on history, as well as those whose extraordinary lives shed light on the times in which they lived, and the legacy of this incredible American people.\n\nKirkus Reviews\nAn earnest, informative companion to the PBS series on the largest and fastest-growing minority in the United States: Latinos, now numbering more than 50 million. Journalist and PBS commentator Suarez (The Holy Vote: The Politics of Faith in America, 2006) notes that, among nations, only Mexico contains more Hispanics than the U.S. &quot;At some point in the 2040s,&quot; writes the author, &quot;a slim majority of Americans will trace their ancestry to people who arrived in this country from someplace other than Europe.&quot; Beginning in the 17th century, Suarez reminds readers that when Englishmen arrived at Massachusetts and Virginia to settle or look for riches while despoiling and killing Indians, Spaniards and colonists from Mexico had been doing the same for 50 years in Florida and the Southwest. After a review of Spanish New World exploration and capsule histories of Mexico, Cuba and Puerto Rico that emphasize their usually painful relations to the U.S., Suarez concentrates on America's Latino legacy from the 19th century to the present. Two themes predominate: racism and immigration. Although not as murderous as that against blacks, discrimination against Latinos has an equally long and troubled history that turns out to be no less true for white America's fear of being overwhelmed with Hispanics pouring across our border. True to TV documentary format, Suarez includes the story of an individual with every section. Few will be familiar, yet many should be--e.g., JosÃƒÂ© MartÃƒÂ­, the hero of Cuban independence, or Juan de OÃƒÂ±ate, founder of the first white settlement in the Southwest. Matters improve greatly as the author approaches the present day and points with pride to famous Latinos from Desi Arnez to Albert Pujols. More journalistic guide than history, the book provides a satisfying antidote to average readers' disturbing ignorance of America's Hispanic heritage.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00b135a3aeef9990313b92dd089cceef67f66e55","amp;dn":"Ray+Suarez+-+Latino+Americans-+The+500-Year+Legacy+That+Shaped+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00b135a3aeef9990313b92dd089cceef67f66e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,177,53,163,174,239,153,144,49,59,146,221,8,156,206,239,103,246,110,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
