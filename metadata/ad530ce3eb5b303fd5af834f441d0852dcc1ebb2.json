In this volume, recent advances in a number of these different areas are reported and reviewed, thus granting some appreciation for the future that ionic liquids research holds, and affording inspiration for those who have not previously considered the application of ionic liquids in their area of interest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad530ce3eb5b303fd5af834f441d0852dcc1ebb2","amp;dn":"Ionic+Liquids+Current+State+of+the+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad530ce3eb5b303fd5af834f441d0852dcc1ebb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,83,12,227,235,91,48,63,213,175,131,79,68,29,8,82,220,193,235,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
