Patina Style gives insight into materials choices, methods and treatments that result in spaces that celebrate the beauty in the old, the imperfect and the slightly worn.\n\nSteve Giannetti and Brooke Giannetti are a design team and owners of Giannetti Home, one of the top design stores in Los Angeles. Their work has been the focus of countless national magazine features and has graced the covers of Veranda and Coastal Living. Steve is one of the most sought-after architects in California.\nA Timeless design style with age-old character.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction, Design","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37aa4b50f9c81d14dc3221e9036306e5ceb3f1a7","amp;dn":"Patina+Style+by+Brooke+and+Steve+Giannetti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37aa4b50f9c81d14dc3221e9036306e5ceb3f1a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,170,75,80,249,200,29,20,220,50,33,233,3,99,6,229,206,179,241,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
