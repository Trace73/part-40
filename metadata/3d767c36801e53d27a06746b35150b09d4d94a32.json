The majority of their tongue in cheek lyrical content deals with themes of horror and science fiction, yet their musical style is upbeat and pop oriented, with elements of garage punk, doo wop and hard rock. Due to their apparent obsession with B Movies and black humour their fanbase extends to the gothic rock, death rock and psychobilly scenes.\n\nAs complete as i can get it .. 2008 - Out Of The Crypt And Into Your Heart Track 13 is about 13 minutes long .. its two song but theres about a 10 minute silence. I asume this was like a hidden bonus track. If your good with editing you could split the track .... enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d767c36801e53d27a06746b35150b09d4d94a32","amp;dn":"Zombina+%26+The+Skeletones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d767c36801e53d27a06746b35150b09d4d94a32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,118,124,54,128,30,83,210,122,6,116,107,53,21,11,9,212,217,74,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
