However, if you find something is missing, email me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d3a0b0e7b0b2bea3b2b0b893b4beb2babffdb0bcbe&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThe CAM is the next step in Simcity 4. With this mod the way your city grows is greatly improved and more balanced. This mod extends the number of &amp;#039;growth stages&amp;#039; from the standard 8 to 15, and increases demand from a max of 6,000 to 24,000 (For Residential and Commercial) and a max of 12,000 for Industry. Also, stage thresholds   (which are the amount of residential, commercial and industrial capacity required to unlock certain growth stage) and stages distribution (The percentage of X growth stage able to grow in the city) are more balanced through the development of your city and regions.\n\nTo be more clear, with this mod you can grow massive skyscrappers and large industrial complexes, all without cheating. This is definitely a must-have for anyone wanting a more realistic city simulator.\n\nBe sure to read the Readme AND the Manual, it explains all you need to know before doing something you might not want to do.\n\nDownload and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd0e335a592da77d1b4450cf01d80360b7b63cad","amp;dn":"Simcity+4+-+CAM+Pack+v2+%28Many+lots+%2B+All+dependencies%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd0e335a592da77d1b4450cf01d80360b7b63cad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,14,51,90,89,45,167,125,27,68,80,207,1,216,3,96,183,182,60,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
