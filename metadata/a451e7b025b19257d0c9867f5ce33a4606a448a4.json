Instructor Karen Voight has an amazingly sculpted body--just try to pry your eyes from her abs, shoulders, or thighs. The 25-minute A.M. Workout starts with a rhythmic warm-up that readies your muscles and raises your heart rate, followed by a full-body, muscle-conditioning series using light weights or weighted balls. It's impressive how many muscle groups are worked in Voight's superbly designed, nonstop sequence of moves and combinations--some coordination required. The P.M. Workout starts with a strong ab routine and some push-ups, followed by a long, slow-paced yoga routine to stretch your muscles and calm your mind.\n\nVideo; x264; 710*480 (4:3); 2273 kbps; 29.970 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a451e7b025b19257d0c9867f5ce33a4606a448a4","amp;dn":"Streamline+Fitness+AM+PM+Workout+with+Karen+Voight+x264+aac+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a451e7b025b19257d0c9867f5ce33a4606a448a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,81,231,176,37,177,146,87,208,201,134,127,92,227,58,70,6,164,72,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
