He has drawn hundreds of thousands to his one-man shows in Quebec, France, Belgium and Switzerland.\n\nHis debut one-man show, A New Comic is Born, ran for more than five hundred performances and earned him two Felix nominations. His second, The New Adventures of Michel Courtemanche, filled theatres in both North America and Europe and spawned his second international hit video.\n\nCourtemanche has internationally sold out enormous houses usually reserved for rock stars (although such shows are quite commonplace for comedians in Quebec). He has even inspired a popular one-of-a-kind hardcover comic book. He has starred in QuÃƒÂ©bÃƒÂ©cois films La Nuit de Noces and Karmina 2, and on the Secret Adventures of Jules Verne television series, on the Sci Fi Channel (United States).\n\nHis style of comedy can be best summed up as mime combined with sound effects, as he is most often seen interacting with invisible objects or even people and using his voice to complete the scene. He is also particularly good at making remarkable grimaces.\n\nDVD Rip\n1h 10 min\nDivX 5\nVideo Bitrate: 1230 Kbps\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps\n544 x 432\nFull Screen(4x3)\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b00cf76f069a3f32a99f66b5bfa5ee752379143","amp;dn":"Le+Meilleur+De+Courtemanche+%2F+The+best+of+Courtemanche","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b00cf76f069a3f32a99f66b5bfa5ee752379143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,0,207,118,240,105,163,243,42,153,246,107,91,250,94,231,82,55,145,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
