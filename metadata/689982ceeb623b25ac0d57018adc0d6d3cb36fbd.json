Alex also talks about the destruction of the global economy with regular guest, Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster. Alex also tackles the important issues of the day and takes your calls. \n\nHour-1: News and rants\nHour-2: Bob Chapman and open lines\nHour-3: Steve Watson\nHour-4: News and open lines\n\n-----------------------------------\nDue to family obligations, a new job, and a need to focus on certain goals in my life I have decided to stop editing and uploading The Alex Jones Show.  It is time for others to step up and get this job done.  I still plan to upload The Jeff Rense Show and The Intelligence Report with Mark Koernke.  Those shows are a bit easier for me to do and fit my schedule better.\n\nI want to make it clear that I am not stopping because of any other reason than my life is too busy to maintain this level of activity.  Spring is almost here and I will be planting a garden and I'm starting a new job and I need to spend more time with my wife and children.  \n\nThis is my last Alex Jones Show to upload.  In order to help jumpstart someone into doing this I have put together a how-to and included it in this torrent.  Feel free to make your own process and do your own thing.  This is just what I do and what the last 8 months have taught me.\n\n-----------------------------------\nRSS feed for my torrent releases:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/5e25814e76fa65cbd08074cfc0553244&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/5e25814e76fa65cbd08074cfc0553244&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:689982ceeb623b25ac0d57018adc0d6d3cb36fbd","amp;dn":"Alex.Jones.Show.2009.02.06-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"689982ceeb623b25ac0d57018adc0d6d3cb36fbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,153,130,206,235,98,59,37,172,13,87,1,138,220,13,109,60,179,111,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
