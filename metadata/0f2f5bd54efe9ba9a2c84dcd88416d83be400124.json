Then I cut and merge the parts with &quot;DVR-MS Editor&quot; 1.2.\nAfterwards the file is converted with PowerDirector 8 to mpg since I think,\nit is the most popular format everybody can handle.\n\nHope, you enjoy my CabRide-torrents and share it to others.\nPlease keep seeding.\n\n*******************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f2f5bd54efe9ba9a2c84dcd88416d83be400124","amp;dn":"Trains.NewZealand.Otira.to.Greymouth.COMPLETE.CabRide.dTV.SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f2f5bd54efe9ba9a2c84dcd88416d83be400124","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,47,91,213,78,254,155,169,162,200,77,205,136,65,109,131,190,64,1,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
