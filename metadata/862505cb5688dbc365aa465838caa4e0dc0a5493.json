Moody, with an explosive temper, closed off and sullen, heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also beautiful, tatted in delicious ways, with a pierced eyebrow and spiky black hair. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rumoured he has piercings in other places, too. Is he really mad, bad and dangerous to know?\n\nDaniel lives with his older brother, Zef, and their home is party central. You want drugs, a good time, liquor, no questions asked? ColtonÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s is the place to go.\n\nWhen Daniel and good girl Lisanne Maclaine have to work together on an assignment, Lisanne finds thereÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot more to the collegeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bad boy than his reputation. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intelligent and funny and good company. And then she discovers his secret, why heÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s so closed off to everyone, and determined to keep people at armsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ length. But being his secret-keeper is harder than she ever dreamed.\n\nRecommended for readers 18+ due to sexual references and sex scenes, some coarse language, drug references and drug use.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862505cb5688dbc365aa465838caa4e0dc0a5493","amp;dn":"Dangerous+to+Know+%26amp%3B+Love+by+Jane+Harvey-Berrick+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862505cb5688dbc365aa465838caa4e0dc0a5493","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,37,5,203,86,136,219,195,101,170,70,88,56,202,164,224,220,10,84,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
