Violent events happen in this story, and our country's current situation is such that\nthese events could indeed come to pass. My friend's fear was that this book might precipitate such violence.\nHe told me to expect to have drugs planted in my car during routine traffic stops, or have other similar\nmiseries befall me and my family. He advised that if I did have this work published, I should use a\npseudonym, employ an intermediary for all publisher contact, and in general prevent myself from being\nlinked to the finished work, to avoid reprisals.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8573a6d80889848931932195509f4c3757f86446","amp;dn":"UNINTENDED+CONSIQUENCES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8573a6d80889848931932195509f4c3757f86446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,115,166,216,8,137,132,137,49,147,33,149,80,159,76,55,87,248,100,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
