After \nstudying at Sera Me monastery, where he received numerous \nteachings from his root guru, Pabongka Rinpoche, Rinpoche \nreceived his geshe degree in 1948. Rinpoche was then confined \nin Lhasa from 1959 until 1976, during which time he \nexperienced relentless interrogation and torture during \nthirty-five of the infamous struggle sessions. \n\nIf I told you what happened on a regular basis, you would find \nit hard to believe.\n\nAt the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Ribur Rinpoche \nspent more than 10 years in Chinese labor camps and was given \na job with the Religious Affairs Office in Tibet. On one of \nhis trips to China, he worked with the Panchen Lama and \nrecovered holy objects ? including the famous Shakyamuni \nBuddha statue in the Ramoche temple ? that had been dismantled \nand shipped to China. He also re-established the destroyed \nstupa of Lama Tsongkhapa, which contained some of Lama \nTsongkhapa's bodily relics.\n\nSince his exile to India in 1985, Ribur Rinpoche wrote \nnumerous biographies of great lamas such as the Thirteenth \nDalai Lama and an extensive history of Tibet, which includes \nhis autobiography. Ribur Rinpoche spent many years living in \nnorthern California where he gave teachings and led retreats, \nbefore returning to India, where he passed away.\n\nFiles in this torrent:\n \nlistoffiles.txt\nribur_rinpoche.jpg\n01_Exchanging Self With Others-1.mp3\n02_Exchanging Self With Others-2.mp3\n\n               3 File(s)     44,470,272 bytes\n\nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nFor more Buddhist Dharma Torrents see: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/lozory&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/lozory&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand see:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n\n @@  @@                                            \n @@ @@                                             \n @@@@     @@@   @@@  @@@@@@@   @@@   @@@@    @@@   \n @@@        @@  @@ @ @@ @@ @@    @@  @@ @@     @@  \n @@@@     @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@ @@   @@@@  \n @@ @@   @@ @@  @@   @@ @@ @@ @@ @@  @@ @@  @@ @@  \n @@  @@   @@@@  @@   @@ @@ @@  @@@@  @@@@    @@@@  \n                                     @@\n\t\t\t             @@          \n\n\n\n            \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fb3ddfdaa1e6695ce431c47bc45206dd757d246","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+-+Ribur+Rinpoche+-+Exchanging+Self+with+Others","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fb3ddfdaa1e6695ce431c47bc45206dd757d246","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,179,221,253,170,30,102,149,206,67,28,71,188,69,32,109,215,87,210,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
