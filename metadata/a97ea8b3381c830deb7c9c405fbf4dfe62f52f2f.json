It contains all studio and live albums so far that I am aware of.\n\n2002 Smofe + Smang: Live In Minneapolis\n2004 Skittish/Rockity Roll\n2005 Haughty Melodic\n2008 Golden Delicious\n2009 Sad Man Happy Man\n2011 Dubious Luxury\n2011 Yes and Also Yes\n2012 The Question Jar Show\n2012 The Flip is Another Honey\n2012 The Lo-Fi Lodge\n2013 Water &amp; Washington\n2013 Circles Super Bon Bon\n\nMost mp3s are 256 and 320 kbps with some of them being 190 VBR. They all sound good on my equipment. All mp3s have been correctly tagged including album artwork.\n\nIf you enjoy Mike's music head over to his website and buy it or get tickets for a show.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mikedoughty.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mikedoughty.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97ea8b3381c830deb7c9c405fbf4dfe62f52f2f","amp;dn":"Mike+Doughty+Discography%2C+February+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a97ea8b3381c830deb7c9c405fbf4dfe62f52f2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,126,168,179,56,28,131,13,235,124,156,64,95,191,77,254,98,245,47,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
