Bruce Cole, Distinguished Professor of Fine Arts at Indiana University and author of numerous books on Italian Renaissance art, begins with the life and work of Giovanni Bellini, the principal founder of Venetian Renaissance painting. He continues with the paintings of Giorgione and the young Titian whose work embodied the new Venetian style. Cole discusses and explains all of Titian's major works--portraits, religious paintings, and nudes--from various points of view and shows how Venetian painting of this period differed from painting in Florence and elsewhere in Italy and became a distinct and fully-developed style of its own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:117f3ef090c2210ed62f4d5d4825a4330816db28","amp;dn":"Titian+And+Venetian+Painting%2C+1450-1590","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"117f3ef090c2210ed62f4d5d4825a4330816db28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,127,62,240,144,194,33,14,214,47,77,93,72,37,164,51,8,22,219,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
