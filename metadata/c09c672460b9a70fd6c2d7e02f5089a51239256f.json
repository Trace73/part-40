The task would take them one and a half millennia to complete.\n\nWhat prompted them to embark on such a colossal project, without the wheel and with only primitive stone tools? How did they move and raise the gigantic blocks that make up Stonehenge's celebrated circle? And what did the alignments of the stones, which track the Sun and Moon with pinpoint precision, really signify?\n\nThis film delves deep into the mysteries of our long-lost past in the search for clues, and comes up with answers that are as surprising as they are thought-provoking.\n\n50 min\n\nVideo; x264; 716*576 (16:9); 1847 kbps; 25.000 fps\nAudio; aac; 160 kbps; 2 ch; 48.0 Khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09c672460b9a70fd6c2d7e02f5089a51239256f","amp;dn":"Stonehenge+Secrets+of+an+Ancient+Monument+DVDRip+x264+aac+%5BMP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09c672460b9a70fd6c2d7e02f5089a51239256f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,156,103,36,96,185,167,15,214,194,215,224,47,80,137,165,18,57,37,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
