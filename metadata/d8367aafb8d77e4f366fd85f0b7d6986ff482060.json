I played this game a few times over the years and packed it all in one to share.\n\nThe evil Lord Draak, who has the power to transform himself into a dragon, has recovered from earlier defeat and returned with his minions to the world of Uma bringing death and mayhem. You must find your way to Draak's lair and slay him in combat. On the way, you must locate the seven crystals and use them to recreate the time orb, without which Draak can not be defeated.\n\nContents:\n\n/Patches\n/Quest Editor\nDarkstone.iso\nInstructions.txt\n\nInfo:\n\nDeveloper-------------- Delphine Software International\nPublisher(s)----------- PlayStation\n----------------------- NA Take-Two Interactive\n----------------------- EU Electronic Arts\n----------------------- Microsoft Windows\n----------------------- Gathering of Developers\nVersion---------------- 1.05b\nPlatform(s)------------ PlayStation, Windows\nRelease date(s)-------- Microsoft Windows -- July 31, 1999\n----------------------- PlayStation -- January 28, 2001\n----------------------- PAL -- March 9, 2001\nGenre(s)--------------- Action RPG\nMode(s)---------------- Single-player, or multiplayer\nMedia/distribution----- CD-ROM\n\nHardware Requirements:\nPentium 233 MMX \n4mb AGP 3d Accelerator or 8mb PCI 3D Accelerator \n16 Bit Colors \n170mb Hard Disk Space \n32mb Ram \n8X CD-Rom Drive \nDirectX 6.1 \nKeyboard &amp; Mouse \n\n1.Mount Darkstone.iso\n2.Install game\n3.Patch up to 1.05b in order\n4.Enjoy the game!\n(Darkstone.iso must be mounted to play)\n\nEasy to get running, no key required.
