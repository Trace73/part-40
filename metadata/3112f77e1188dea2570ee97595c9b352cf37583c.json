Their self-titled first album was self-released in 2000 and was a combination of death metal, black metal and grindcore. The following positive response earned the band a record deal with AdipocÃƒÂ¨re Records in early 2001. During the 2001 recording sessions, Benighted moved towards a more technical form of death metal and released their second album, Psychose, in 2003. For the subsequent touring, Remy Aubrespin took over on bass.\n\nThe band entered studio in late 2004, without a bassist. After the 2004 release of Insane Cephalic Production, bassist Eric Lombard joined as a new member. Benighted subsequently toured throughout Europe with Morbid Angel, Deicide and Fear Factory among others.\n\nBenighted released their fourth album Identisick in 2006 and Fayolle was replaced by Kevin &quot;Kikou&quot; Foley on drums. The band signed a new deal with Osmose Productions in 2007 and released Icon in October that year. In late 2009, Benighted signed to Season of Mist and released Asylum Cave in 2011. Truchan contributed guest vocals to 2011 album Global Flatline by Aborted. A music video for the song &quot;Let The Blood Spill Between My Broken Teeth&quot; was released in February 2012.\nMembers\n\nCurrent members\n\n    Julien Truchan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Adrien GuÃƒÂ©rin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (2012-present)\n    Olivier Gabriel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Eric Lombard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2004Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n    Kevin Foley Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2006Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\n\nFormer members\n\n    Liem N'Guyen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2012)\n    Fred Fayolle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2006)\n    RÃƒÂ©mi Aubrespin Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (2002)\n    Chart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass (1998Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2002)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3112f77e1188dea2570ee97595c9b352cf37583c","amp;dn":"Beknighted+-+Carnivore+Sublime+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+2CD+MP3+320k+ak6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3112f77e1188dea2570ee97595c9b352cf37583c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,18,247,126,17,136,222,162,87,14,233,117,149,201,179,82,207,55,88,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
