ENJoY! \n\n\nMbuti Pygmies of the Ituri Rainforest \n\nVarious Artists \n\nNotes: The music of the Mbuti is primarily focused around vocal music, \nand this recording beautifully captures the extraordinary variety and \ntonal quality of the solo and choral traditions. The songs are primarily \nabout the Mbuti's nomadic life and the forest, from which their lives \nand those of the animal kingdom are sustained. This compilation set a \nnew standard for quality ethnic field recordings for all labels in \nethnic music. These prized recordings have been remastered and resequenced \nto reflect Dr. Turnbull's original mode: the recording begins in the \nforest with music associated with hunting and gathering, then moves to \nthe village for a Bantu initiation ritual and finally returns to the \nforest for the Mbuti rituals. This record documents the music discussed \nin the book The Forest People, read by many anthropology classes. A \nsuperbly annotated favorite among world music enthusiasts. \n&quot;...[F]rom the moment Colin Turnbull lets the chatter and work rhythms \nof the encampment he's approaching engulf the jungle's ambient insect \nand bird music, I'm hooked.&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ The Village Voice \n\nCountry of Origin: Congo (Democratic Republic)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e1b9e41ee4870b640064578b7d983a26265e23","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Mbuti+Pygmies+Of+The+Ituri+Rainforest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e1b9e41ee4870b640064578b7d983a26265e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,225,185,228,30,228,135,11,100,0,100,87,139,125,152,58,38,38,94,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
