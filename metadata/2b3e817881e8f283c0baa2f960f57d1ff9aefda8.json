Here the mad professor overtakes the scientist with this massive step into a warmer dub (and at some points muscular dubstep). In proper style, Deadbeat collaborates with vocalists Jah Cutta, Bubbz and Moral Undulations on three tracks as he unpacks the tale of his worldly travels. Harder, rougher and meatier than his more ephemeral early offerings, Deadbeat manages to retain his sensitivity and technical finesse while bulking up his beats and rubbing dirt into his grooves. Gimme a Little Slack is full-on bashment ÃƒÂ¢?? party music built of bass and irresistible percussive riddims that wind their way into both your mind and hips. This is DeadbeatÃƒÂ¢??s finest journey yet, mad studio science that reorders old and new worlds of dub.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/991591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/991591&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b3e817881e8f283c0baa2f960f57d1ff9aefda8","amp;dn":"Deadbeat+-+Journeyman%5C%27s+Annual","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b3e817881e8f283c0baa2f960f57d1ff9aefda8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,62,129,120,129,232,242,131,192,186,162,249,96,245,125,31,249,174,253,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
