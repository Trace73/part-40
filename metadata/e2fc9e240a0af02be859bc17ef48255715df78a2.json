While in the Democratic Republic of Congo with War Child Canada, band members Deryck, Steve, Cone and Dave get caught in the middle of a tense battle between heavily armed rebel soldiers and government troops. The war in Congo has been characterized as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and the most deadly war ever documented in Africa. More than 3 million people have been killed in the last 6 years, making it the most lethal conflict since World War II.\n\nThe film crew follows Sum 41 in May 2004 as they meet Congolese children and youth caught in the crossfire, including child soldiers and victims of assault. Sum 41's harrowing experience is caught on film as they witness firsthand what it is like to struggle for survival in a country where, since 1998, war has been more prevalent than peace.\n\nSum 41 are Deryck Whibley, Dave Baksh, Jason McCaslin and Steve Jocz.\n\nAired on MTV's think on September 21st, 2005, this is the DVD-Version though.\n\nFile:  424 MB (444668602),  Duration: 0:52:02 (3122), Language: English/French\nVideo: 376 MB, 1011 Kbps, 29.970 fps, 720*480 (4:3),  DivX (OpenDivx v4)\nAudio: 47 MB, 128 Kbps, MPEG Layer-3\n\nGet involved and donate to War Child Canada, they do an awful load of good: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.warchild.ca/getinvolved_donate.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.warchild.ca/getinvolved_donate.asp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fc9e240a0af02be859bc17ef48255715df78a2","amp;dn":"Rocked+-+Sum+41+in+Congo+-+REPOST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fc9e240a0af02be859bc17ef48255715df78a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,252,158,36,10,10,240,43,232,89,188,23,239,72,37,87,21,223,120,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
