This \nyear, Silverchair rocks the small country town of Cowra in NSW, with an audience of around \n15,000 fans who travelled from all over the region to be a part of the massive event. \n\nThe band performs a range of their latest songs from their new album &quot;Young Modern&quot; as well as \nclassics from their previous albums. \n\n\n\nSet List:\n01 - Young Modern Station\n02 - Emotion Sickness\n03 - The Greatest View\n04 - Luv Your Life\n05 - The Door\n06 - Ana&amp;#039;s Song (open fire)\n07 - Insomnia\n08 - Straight lines\n09 - Mind Reader\n10 - Freak\n11 - If you keep losing Sleep\n\n\nNotes:\nThe set list above is as it appeared on the televised concert shown by ABC2, and does not include\n6 songs that were played in the original set list. This was probably to keep the show within an \nhour timeframe. The songs not included in this release are floating around in mp3 format, but not \nvideo. \n\nApart from that, we hope you enjoy a fine performance by Silverchair!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b7843d961d19ae16c3ad67d419fd3d3bf693dfe","amp;dn":"Silverchair+Live+-+One+Night+Stand+DTV+DivX-+DREATiCA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b7843d961d19ae16c3ad67d419fd3d3bf693dfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,120,67,217,97,209,154,225,108,58,214,125,65,159,211,211,191,105,61,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
