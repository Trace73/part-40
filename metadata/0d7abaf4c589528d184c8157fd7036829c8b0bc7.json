But President Wilson remained unshakable in his neutrality. Then, with a single stroke, the tool to propel America into the war came into a quiet British office. One of countless messages intercepted by the crack team of British decoders, the Zimmermann telegram was a top-secret message from Berlin inviting Mexico to join Japan in an invasion of the United States: Mexico would recover her lost American territories while keeping the U.S. occupied on her side of the Atlantic. How Britain managed to inform America of Germany's plan without revealing that the German codes had been broken makes for an incredible, true story of espionage, intrigue, and international politics as only Barbara W. Tuchman could tell it.\n\nREVIEWS\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA true, lucid thrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦A tremendous tale of hushed and unhushed uproars in the linked fields of war and diplomacyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦Mrs. Tuchman makes the most of it with a creative writerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sense of drama and a scholarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obeisance to the evidence.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½New York Times\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe tale has most of the ingredients of an Eric Ambler spy thriller.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Saturday Review\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHistorian Barbara Tuchman tells of a secret telegram sent from the German foreign minister to the Mexican government in 1917. The message, which announced the beginning of unrestricted submarine warfare against Allied shipping, attempted to turn the sympathies of Mexico toward Germany with the promise of territorial rewards. The British decoded the message and leaked the contents to the U.S., hoping to provoke President Wilson to join WWI on the English side. Reading at a pace complementary to the author's abundant flow of information, narrator Wanda McCaddon employs her award-winning talents to the fullest. She takes command of Tuchman's prodigious vocabulary, making it sound comfortable and fluent. Her addition of appropriate foreign accents adds to the diplomatic intrigue.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½AudioFile\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThis is well-crafted history that flows like a novel. Wanda McCaddon captures the storyteller tone of TuchmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s prose. You could be sitting across the table drinking coffee and learning that, unlike what you learned in high school, the sinking of the Lusitania is not the only reason America joined the Great War. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about President WilsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s naÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯ve adherence to neutrality despite the warnings of his advisors and about the GermansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ cynicism and arrogance as they try to manipulate events and countries to their advantage. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find out that the British through ingenuity and planning were reading German codes they thought were unbreakable and about the balancing act the British had to play to protect their source while at the same time informing the Americans. Whether youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re a history buff or not, you can learn from The Zimmermann Telegram. It captures the people and events in an era when personalities and alliances were every bit as convoluted as they are now.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½SoundCommentary.com\n\nBARBARA W.
