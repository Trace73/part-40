Why? How will they survive?\n\nA mother polar bear and her cub make their first journey together onto the sea ice. They are looking for ringed seals, their favourite prey. It is a serious business but the cub just wants to play. The melting ice makes it harder for them to hunt and threatens their survival.\n\nIn a unique aerial sequence, the migration of narwhal with their distinctive unicorn-like tusks is filmed for the first time. The whales' journey is risky as they travel along giant cracks in the ice. If the ice were to close above them, they would drown.\n\nHundreds of beluga whales gather in the river shallows. They rub themselves on smooth pebbles in one of the most bizarre summer spectacles.\n\nGuillemot chicks take their first flights from precipitous sea cliff nests to the sea 300 metres below. They attempt to glide to safety but many miss their target. Their loss is a bonus for the hungry Arctic fox family waiting below.\n\nAs the melt comes to an end the bears gather, waiting for the sea to freeze again. Two 400kg males square up to each other to spar.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc07dd9b7242880f6b3ada64c8f55eff2d32135f","amp;dn":"natures.great.events.s01e01.720p.hdtv.x264-sfm.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc07dd9b7242880f6b3ada64c8f55eff2d32135f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,7,221,155,114,66,136,15,107,58,218,100,200,245,94,255,45,50,19,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
