It is about the creation of illusions, advertisement, influence on the voters, CIA experiments for mind control and propaganda methods. Despite being almost 30 years old, it is suprisingly very relevant for today. It promotes the values of rationalism over irrationalism of American popular culture.\n\nThe director of the film Felix Sobolev, died during the production of the film at age 52. The film was  finished by Victor Olender.\n\nThe film has English subtitles.   \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCountry: USSR\n\nDirectors: Felix Sobolev, Victor Olender\n\nYear: 1984\n\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0dc9cb284491e7a3325f8375859d48b4de5edc39","amp;dn":"The+target+is+your+brain+1984","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0dc9cb284491e7a3325f8375859d48b4de5edc39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,201,203,40,68,145,231,163,50,95,131,117,133,157,72,180,222,94,220,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
