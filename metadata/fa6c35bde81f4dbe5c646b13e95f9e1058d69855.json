From ghosts to vampires, zombies to vengeful spirits, these stories take you from a soft-apocalyptic future where computers are symbiotic creatures burrowing into your skin, to a post-apocalyptic world where cowboys round-up zombies for slaughter. \n\nYou'll witness vampires hosting the birthday party of the century in an antebellum mansion in the old south and a young boy beginning to understand that the evil he does will come back to haunt him.\n\nGenre: Horror Short Stories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6c35bde81f4dbe5c646b13e95f9e1058d69855","amp;dn":"Fierce+as+the+Grave%3A+A+Quartet+of+Horror+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa6c35bde81f4dbe5c646b13e95f9e1058d69855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,108,53,189,232,31,77,190,92,100,107,19,233,95,158,16,88,214,152,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
