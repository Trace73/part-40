Whether you've already upgraded or are still deciding, you'll learn practical yet non-destructive editing techniques you can use every day. This 3-day course is a perfect companion to Lesa's previous CS5 class on creativeLIVE. Lesa will go further in-depth into advanced filters such as Puppet Warp, Liquify, and Lighting Effects, which all take advantage of the new processing power of CS6. Lesa will spend a full day covering Photoshop's brand new video features.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1456a48b1c2a931530383ff6a7dc54a68e4d68f7","amp;dn":"creativeLIVE.Adobe.Photoshop.CS6.New.Features.with.Lesa.Snider.H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1456a48b1c2a931530383ff6a7dc54a68e4d68f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,86,164,139,28,42,147,21,48,56,63,246,167,220,84,166,142,77,104,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
