He keeps the news to himself in order not to spoil the family's remaining time at the resort. While lounging at the swimming pool, he sees two French girls in their teens jump in, and starts to develop an interest in them. After his son intentionally locks him out of the family's hotel room, he takes his daughter to the rides of the Magic Kingdom to spend time away from his nagging wife.\n\nTheir paths frequently cross that of the two French girls, whom Jim tries to keep up with. His son, working with a wheelchair-bound man, makes attempts on his life. The Disney characters and paraphernalia start to seem sinister and surreal, and White starts to have disturbing visions, such as the audio-animatronic characters' faces changing and the Disney Princesses doubling as escorts for wealthy Asian businessmen visiting the park. He is not sure if what he sees is real, or if he is just having a breakdown.\n\nEventually he is apprehended by park security, who seem inordinately concerned about a &quot;cat flu&quot; sweeping the park. He is taken to a secret detention facility under Epcot's Spaceship Earth and interrogated about his possible role in this. After being brainwashed, he is released, and watches as Spaceship Earth is blown up. At the end of the film, he dies at the Contemporary Resort, apparently of cat flu. Disney cleaners swoop in on the scene and clean all evidence that a death occurred, and take Jim's body away in an unmarked van.\n\n\n\n* enjoy ...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed359d42ee604ab0d246294bc494c90f5335f3e2","amp;dn":"Escape+from+Tomorrow+HDRip.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed359d42ee604ab0d246294bc494c90f5335f3e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,53,157,66,238,96,74,176,210,70,41,75,196,148,201,15,83,53,243,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
