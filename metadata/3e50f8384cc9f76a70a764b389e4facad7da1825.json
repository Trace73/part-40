It&amp;#039;s a primal, sickening howl from the depths of   \n          Layne Staley&amp;#039;s heroin addiction, and one of the most harrowing concept albums ever   \n          recorded. Not every song on Dirt is explicitly about heroin, but Jerry Cantrell&amp;#039;s    \n          solo-written contributions (nearly half the album) effectively maintain the thematic \n          coherence -- nearly every song is imbued with the morbidity, self-disgust, and/or    \n          resignation of a self-aware yet powerless addict. Cantrell&amp;#039;s technically limited but \n          inventive guitar work is by turns explosive, textured, and queasily disorienting,    \n          keeping the listener off balance with atonal riffs and off-kilter time signatures.   \n          Staley&amp;#039;s stark confessional lyrics are similarly effective, and consistently         \n          miserable. Sometimes he&amp;#039;s just numb and apathetic, totally desensitized to the       \n          outside world; sometimes his self-justifications betray a shockingly casual          \n          amorality; his moments of self-recognition are permeated by despair and suicidal     \n          self-loathing. Even given its subject matter, Dirt is monstrously bleak, closely     \n          resembling the cracked, haunted landscape of its cover art. The album holds out      \n          little hope for its protagonists (aside from the much-needed survival story of       \n          &quot;Rooster,&quot; a tribute to Cantrell&amp;#039;s Vietnam-vet father), but in the end, it&amp;#039;s redeemed\n          by the honesty of its self-revelation and the sharp focus of its music.              \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Them bones                  [02:30]                                        \n                 02.Dam that river              [03:09]                                        \n                 03.Rain when I die             [06:02]                                        \n                 04.Down in A hole              [05:38]                                        \n                 05.Sickman                     [05:30]                                        \n                 06.Rooster                     [06:15]                                        \n                 07.Junkhead                    [05:09]                                        \n                 08.Dirt                        [05:16]                                        \n                 09.Godsmack                    [03:51]                                        \n                 10.Untitled                    [00:44]                                        \n                 11.Hate to feel                [05:16]                                        \n                 12.Angry chair                 [04:48]                                        \n                 13.Would                       [03:28]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               57:36 min                                       \n                                                88,7 MB                          ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e50f8384cc9f76a70a764b389e4facad7da1825","amp;dn":"Alice+In+Chains+-+Dirt+VBR.MP3.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e50f8384cc9f76a70a764b389e4facad7da1825","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,80,248,56,76,201,247,106,112,167,100,179,137,228,250,202,215,218,24,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
