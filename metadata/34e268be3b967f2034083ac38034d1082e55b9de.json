This lineup recorded the band's second release, The Scientists EP (released February 1980) and did two tours of Melbourne and Sydney, in December 1979 and February/March 1980. In Melbourne, the band appeared on pop TV show Countdown, performing &quot;Last Night&quot; from the EP.\n\nJuniper left the band in May 1980 and Salmon, Baker and Sharples continued as a three-piece.
