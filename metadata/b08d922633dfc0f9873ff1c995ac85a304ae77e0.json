Instead, it does something that virtually no other Elements book has ever doneÃ¢â‚¬â€it tells you flat-out which settings to use, when to use them, and why. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re looking for one of those Ã¢â‚¬Å“tell-me-everything-about-the-Unsharp-Mask-filterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ books, this isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it. You can grab any other Elements book on the shelf, because they all do that. Instead, this book gives you the inside tips and tricks of the trade for organizing, correcting, editing, sharpening, retouching, and printing your photos like a pro. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be absolutely amazed at how easy and effective these techniques areÃ¢â‚¬â€once you know the secrets.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 456 pages\n# Publisher: Peachpit Press; 1 edition (December 31, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 032180824X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321808240","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b08d922633dfc0f9873ff1c995ac85a304ae77e0","amp;dn":"The+Photoshop+Elements+10+Book+for+Digital+Photographers%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b08d922633dfc0f9873ff1c995ac85a304ae77e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,141,146,38,51,223,192,249,135,63,241,201,149,172,133,163,4,174,119,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
