He talks about the state of affairs regarding the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri, brings his Twitter to life by reading some replies he received the night before, and takes calls regarding this whole situation. Ant then discusses the death of Robin Williams and the demons that a lot of comedians suffer with.
