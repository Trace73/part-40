From the small town of Vichy in central France, Field Marshall Petain's puppet government worked with their nazi overlords in creating pro-Nazi propaganda. Seeking to turn the tide of public emotion against both the Allied Forces and the Jews, they skillfully produced a strange alternative history of the war years that is shocking and grimly fascinating. French New Wave founder Claude Chabrol creates a masterful look at Nazis and media manipulation that is as engrossing as any of his thrillers.\n\nProduct Description\n\nFrench New Wave founder Claude Chabrol (Merci Pour Le Chocolat, La CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©monie) creates a masterful look at the Nazis' media manipulation, which is as engrossing as any of his thrillers. Chabrol assembles a brilliant compilation of long forgotten film footage and newsreels produced by the Nazis and French collaborators during World War Two. \n\nWritten by Jean-Pierre Azema and Robert Paxton and narrated by Joe Cox (Manhunter; The Ring), The Eye of Vichy focuses on the small town of the same name in central France where Field Marshall Petain's puppet government worked with their Nazi overlords to create pro-Nazi propaganda. Seeking to turn the tide of public emotion against both the Allied Forces and the Jews, these collaborators skillfully produced a strange alternative history of the war years that is both shocking and grimly fascinating.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d893e09b998d9f0afaf9fb5d7e4ae73db0c1b17d","amp;dn":"Eye+of+Vichy+%28Unedited+Nazi+Propaganda+Newsreels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d893e09b998d9f0afaf9fb5d7e4ae73db0c1b17d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,147,224,155,153,141,159,10,250,249,251,93,126,74,231,61,176,193,177,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
