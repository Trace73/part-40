Cordes AKA Prince Be and Jarrett Cordes AKA DJ Minute Mix.\nTheir cousin Dr. Giggles aka Doc G was added to the lineup for their 2005 comeback, right after which Jarrett was fired from the band. PM Dawn continued with Doc G replacing Jarrett. It has lately been informed that Attrell Cordes suffered from a few strokes and that his health status does not allow him to continue with the band.\n\nIn the current state of affairs, their cousin Doc G has practically &quot;inherited&quot; the PM Dawn flag, and is touring as PM Dawn performing their songs.\n\n\n\nALBUMS AND TRACK LIST:\n\n\nP.M.
