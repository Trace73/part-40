The unprepared who refused to believe that such a thing could happen here will live as wretched refugees--if they live at all. But for the prepared--for the city survivors--life will go on. America's leading survival author debunks the myth that the only way to survive is to stock a retreat in the mountains. He tells urban dwellers how to find water; trap and butcher game; preserve food; position a retreat for maximum safety; avoid troops; and barter with other survivors. You'll learn which weapons are absolute necessities and which aren't worth having, and confront the all-important topic of survival nursing care. Ragnar gives you the solid information you will need to make it if the worst-case scenario becomes a reality.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRagnar Benson is America's most-esteemed survival expert. He has written more than 20 books for Paladin throughout the years on a variety of topics covering everything from weapons to politics to survival medicine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdd2c964a261694e7c513c3bafccf2f2f340a864","amp;dn":"Ragnar%27s+Urban+Survival+%282000%29+%28Pdf%2C+Epub%2C+Mobi%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdd2c964a261694e7c513c3bafccf2f2f340a864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,210,201,100,162,97,105,78,124,81,60,59,175,204,242,242,243,64,168,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
