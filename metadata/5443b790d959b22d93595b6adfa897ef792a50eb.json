But he has also gained new allies, a new sense of purpose, and something he never in a million years would have thought would be a plus: the cannibal savant known as Elsbeth.\r\nNow facing certain destruction from a faction known as the Consortium, Jace needs Elsbeth's help more than ever. But is she up to the task when her past is revealed? A past that is possibly more shocking than the zombie apocalypse itself?\r\nJace may find out the hard way. And in the zombie apocalypse, the hard way usually means a whole lot of people are going to die","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5443b790d959b22d93595b6adfa897ef792a50eb","amp;dn":"Jake+Bible+-+Z-Burbia+3+-+Estate+of+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5443b790d959b22d93595b6adfa897ef792a50eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,67,183,144,217,89,178,45,147,89,91,106,223,168,151,239,121,42,80,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
