Then Converted to 192k AAC.  I think MGM was to cheap to pay Carpenter and Russell royalties so it was left off the Blu-ray release.\n\nAfter matching the waveform of the soundtrack up to the commentary it just needed 2 seconds of silence inserted to the beginning of the track.  So it was pretty easy :-)\n\nUse MKVmerge GUI (available here - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.videohelp.com/tools/MKVtoolnix&quot;&gt;MKV toolnix&lt;/a&gt; ) to remux this file to your Blu-ray rip!\n\nThis is a fantastic and educational commentary track that shouldn't be lost to time!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df1b0d3134847c8d1af3cd47bac0b43a52883e3e","amp;dn":"Escape+From+New+York+Commentary+-+John+Carpenter+%2B+Kurt+Russell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df1b0d3134847c8d1af3cd47bac0b43a52883e3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,27,13,49,52,132,124,141,26,243,205,71,186,192,180,58,82,136,62,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
