This is essentially the Bible for those who ride freight trains in the United States. It consists of a great deal of localized information pertaining to trainyards &amp; lines in the US.  Schedules, locations, places to get in &amp; out, the local situation with police, etc.  The only problem is that it's been something of an underground document &amp; consequently hard to come by.\r\n\r\nNo longer!  It's been scanned &amp; now made available on The Pirate Bay.\r\n\r\nIt appears the author is fairly virulent in exerting his claimed copyright privileges.  In particular, he doesn't want it distributed on the Internet in any way or form.  By posting this on The Pirate Bay, as much an anti-copyright advocacy site as an Internet torrent tracker, I hope it's obvious what I think about all of that.  (Hypocritically, a fair number of the same people who break laws relating to the physical property rights of railroad companies on a regular basis have no qualms about invoking the US's Digital Millenium Copyright Act--premised upon the dubious concept of intellectual property--whenever this document appears online.)\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in freighthopping in the US, download this &amp; spread it far &amp; wide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f3cb4a9c25019d22a858956f564b826834a2f0","amp;dn":"Crew+Change+Guide+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f3cb4a9c25019d22a858956f564b826834a2f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,243,203,74,156,37,1,157,34,168,88,149,111,86,75,130,104,52,162,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
