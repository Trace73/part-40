Flapping up a notch to number nine, here are A Flock Of Seagulls, and 'I Ran.'&quot;\n\n\n100TH TORRENTED AT40 BROADCAST!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ALL THE SEEDERS! DON'T WORRY IF YOU SEE ZERO SEEDERS ON SOME OF MY AT40 TORRENTS. DOWNLOAD THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE I'M STILL SEEDING!\n\nI HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST HUNDRED SHOWS AND HERE'S TO MANY MORE! (And just wait till you see what I got you for Christmas!)\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nLionel Richie is at number 36 (on his way to number one) with his first solo hit, &quot;Truly.&quot;\n\nThis is a magic countdown with &quot;Abracadabra&quot; by The Steve Miller Band at number ten and &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; by America at number eight.\n\nThis is also an explosive countdown with &quot;Athena&quot; by The Who (&quot;She's a bomb&quot;) at number thirty and &quot;You Dropped A Bomb On Me&quot; by The Gap Band at number thirty-one.\n\nNot to mention there is a song called &quot;American Heartbeat&quot; at number 27, a band named America (again, at number eight), and the number one song is from the album &quot;American Fool.&quot;\n\nThe Jackson Five was the first group of the rock era to hit the top five with their first six chart singles. The Australian group that broke that record by putting their first seven hits in the top five has a song in this countdown.\n\nIn the rock era, only three pairs of recording acts with the same name have ever hit the top 40. There have been two sets of Temptations and two Johnny (or Johnnie) Taylors. Then there is a song in this countdown by a woman who has the same name as another woman who charted in 1973 with a song called &quot;Pillow Talk.&quot;\n\nMy apologies to all Pink Floyd fans as Casey somewhat butchers lyrics from &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot; as he introduces &quot;You Don't Want Me Anymore&quot; (at number 24) by Steel Breeze. (Go download Pink Floyd's 1975 album, &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot; It's a masterpiece.)\n\nA listener wants to know, &quot;What American all-male group in the rock era has had the most number one hits?&quot; It's a tie between three groups whose first number one's were &quot;Sherrie&quot;, &quot;Get Down Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Best Of My Love.&quot;\n\nLW#3: Eye In The Sky - The Alan Parsons Project\nLW#2: Who Can It Be Now - Men At Work\nLW#1: Jack And Diane - John Cougar\n40:    Get Closer - Linda Ronstadt\n39:    Rock This Town - The Stray Cats\n38:    Young Love - Air Supply        \n37:    Love Me Tomorrow - Chicago     \n36:    Truly - Lionel Richie     \n35:    I Get Excited - Rick Springfield\nLDD: Hey Jude - The Beatles    \n34:    Mickey - Toni Basil\n33:    Pressure - Billy Joel\n32:    Steppin' Out - Joe Jackson\n31:    You Dropped A Bomb On Me - The Gap Band\n30:    Athena - The Who\n29:    Muscles - Diana Ross    \n28:    Southern Cross - Crosby, Stills And Nash\n27:    American Heartbeat - Survivor\n26:    Sweet Time - Reo Speedwagon\n25:    Nobody - Sylvia\n24:    You Don't Want Me Anymore - Steel Breeze\n23:    New World Man - Rush\n22:    Love Come Down - Evelyn King\n21:    Big Fun - Kool &amp; The Gang\n20:    The One You Love - Glenn Frey\n19:    What's Forever For - Michael Murphy\n18:    Eye Of The Tiger - Survivor\n17:    Don't Fight It - Kenny Loggins with Steve Perry\n16:    Hard To Say I'm Sorry - Chicago\n15:    Hold On - Santana\n14:    Gloria - Laura Branigan\n13:    Heartlight - Neil Diamond\n12:    Gypsy - Fleetwood Mac\n11:    Break It To Me Gently - Juice Newton\n10:    Abracadabra - The Steve Miller Band\n9:    I Ran - A Flock Of Seagulls\nLDD: Thank You For Being A Friend - Andrew Gold\n8:    You Can Do Magic - America\n7:    Somebody's Baby - Jackson Browne\n6:    Heart Attack - Olivia Newton-John\n5:    Up Where We Belong - Joe Cocker and Jennifer Warnes\n4:    I Keep Forgettin' (Every Time You're Here) - Michael McDonald\n3:    Eye In The Sky - The Alan Parsons Project\n2:    Who Can It Be Now - Men At Work\n1:    Jack And Diane - John Cougar\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dca75fe874a2c14c6ceb0e3b02f6581923e16851","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1982_October_23rd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dca75fe874a2c14c6ceb0e3b02f6581923e16851","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,167,95,232,116,162,193,76,108,235,14,59,2,246,88,25,35,225,104,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
