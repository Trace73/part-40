Space  has  never  looked  so\n  inviting - but images can betray..\n\n  It has been two years since the end of the  second  Gemini  war,  and  the\n  situation in the wartorn system  is  further  from  resolution  than  ever\n  before. The collection of freedom fighters  named  Gemini  League  is  now\n  reduced to a small group, with no power or influence, after  losing  their\n  leaders. The Empire meanwhile, has used the re-opened Starpoint to  occupy\n  the once renegade Gemini sector - and beyond.\n\n  A multitude of  Imperial  warship  fleets  and  mammoth  motherships  have\n  crushed every trace of opposition. The situation was looking  bleak,  when\n  they suddenly halted their armada and re-shifted their focus on fortifying\n  Starpoint with staggering numbers. Rumours  soon  spread  that  they  were\n  afraid of something coming after them through the T-gate,  from  what  was\n  supposed to be the core of the Empire. What are  they  running  from  that\n  makes even the mighty Empire tremble?\n\n  Starpoint Gemini 2 will take players on a breath taking journey, with dark\n  secrets and unimaginable twists that will finally  unveil  the  incredible\n  truth..\n\n  Features:\n  =========\n\n  * Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system, now coupled\n    with dynamic real-time 3D combat.\n  * Explore the dynamic game world as a whole,\n    rather than through individual maps.\n  * Use T-Gates, wormholes and riftways to travel\n    faster around the Gemini system .\n  * Fifty diverse factions ranging from states and companies\n    to outlaws, locked in a powerstruggle, with over 100\n    commodities to trade or plunder.\n  * Special revocable licenses acquired from factions\n    offer various bonuses and unlock new options.\n  * Hire mercenary captains to follow you on your travels and\n    share your fate, and employ officers to fill key positions\n    on your ship (engineering, navigation, tactical).\n  * Random missions get generated depending on the\n    player's actions and allegiances.\n  * Over 70 unique ships, fully upgradeable with various ship\n    systems, with a.o. visible turrets, and a large arsenal of\n    destructive weapons to blast enemies to pieces.\n  * Direct ship controls create complete immersion.\n  * Advanced physics provided by NVIDIA PhysX technology\n\n  Installation Information:\n  =========================\n\n  * Burn or mount\n  * Install\n  * Play the game\n\n  NOTE: As usual, block the game exe in your firewall.\n\n                                                              /TEAM FAiRLIGHT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e77ec4537d5789dc6a9c6a96b8ddb4c2e57697b","amp;dn":"Starpoint.Gemini.2-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e77ec4537d5789dc6a9c6a96b8ddb4c2e57697b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,119,236,69,55,213,120,157,198,169,198,169,107,141,219,76,46,87,105,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
