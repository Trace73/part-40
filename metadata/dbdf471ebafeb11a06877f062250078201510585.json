This way IsoBuster can access data that Windows can't.\n\nIsoBuster also supports a wide range of image file formats, such as: *.DAO, *.TAO, *.ISO, *.BIN, *.IMG, *.CIF, *.FCD, *.NRG, *.GCD, *.P01, *.C2D, .CUE, \n*.CD, *.GI and more ... It uses several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data, even if Windows is not able to do so. It is a very useful and easy to use program.\n\nAdditional features include Mpg (*.dat) Extraction, Scanning for missing files and folders, CDText support and much more. A good portion of the features are available for free, however certain advanced features such as UDF, HFS, IFO and FAT support are only available in a registered version.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;IsoBuster&quot;:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Data recovery from CD, DVD, BD and HD DVD.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Better Error handling and several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data anyway.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The use of alternative ways to get to the data, get the best out of your CD/DVD-ROM drive.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The use of alternative File-Systems to get to the data, make use of all content.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· CDs stay 'readable' after problems (such as Buffer Under-run).\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Read and Extraction of files, CD/DVD images, tracks and sessions from all optical media.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports : CD-i, VCD, SACD, SVCD, CD-ROM, CD-ROM XA, CD-R, CD-RW, ...\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports : DVD-ROM, DVCD, DVD-RAM, DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW, DVD+R DL, DVD-R DL, DVD+RW DL, ...\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports : DVD+VR, DVD+VRW, DVD-VM, DVD-VR, DVD-VRW, ...\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports : BD-ROM, BD-R, BD-R DL, BD-RE, BD-RE DL, BD-R SRM, BD-R RRM, BD-R SRM+POW, BD-R SRM-POW, BDAV, BDMV\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Supports : HD DVD-ROM, HD DVD-R, HD DVD-R DL, HD DVD-RW, HD DVD-RW DL, HD DVD-RAM, HD DVD-Video\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Mpg (*.dat) Extraction and dat2mpg 'in one'.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Enormous File System coverage and ways to use them all (find the best one for your needs).\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· ISO9660, Joliet, Romeo (Short File-names Long File-names on mastered CDs)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Big Endian (Motorola), Little Endian (Intel) (Windows vs. Unix, Mac and other systems' defaults)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· UDF 1.02 (e.g DVDs), UDF 1.5 (e.g. Packet writing on CD-R and CD-RW), UDF 2.01 - UDF 2.60 - FAT 12, FAT 16 and FAT 32 support\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· HFS and HFS+, the Apple Mac file system.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Full Mac properties, Resource Fork and MacBinary extraction support for ISO9660 and Joliet\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Full Mac properties, Resource Fork and MacBinary extraction support for UDF\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Rock Ridge (e.g. for Commodore users, Server use, etc.)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· VIDEO DVD interpretation based on IFO/BUP and VOB files\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Support for the VIDEO +VR standard\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Show and allow to extract the different recordings\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· AUDIO DVD interpretation based on IFO/BUP and VOB files.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Show and allow to extract the Audio recordings/tracks\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Information on and File system properties (must for FS developers)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Scanning for lost files and folders (UDF, ISO, ...) .\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Find lost data on CD, DVD, BD and HD DVD created discs with drag and drop applications (Direct CD, InCD, DLA, Instant-Write, Drag to disc, ...)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Find lost pictures created and saved to CD with Mavica or other digital cameras.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Find lost ISO9660/Joliet sessions\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Find files based on their signature.
