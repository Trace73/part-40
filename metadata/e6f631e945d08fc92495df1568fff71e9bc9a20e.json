Still produces C, C++, and Windows applications\nthat are leaner and faster than anything that the .NET compilers can produce today.\n\n-Produses dsp/dsw projects.\n-Excellent for learning, it will not distract you w/  today's busy Visual Studio displays.\n-No signatures, if you write a naughty program (but not guarranteed w/ updates).\n-Well behaving, it will not interfere w/ your fancy-schmancy 2008 or '10 compiler.\n\nI uploaded it in the past with the MSDN disks. The disks would increase the size from\nthe current 83MB to over 1.1GB. I guess you can connect to the MSDN Site instead.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Unzip to decompress the compiler.\n\n2. Open the text file 'Serial' inside the compiler. Leave it open.\n\n3. Run the Setup.exe (the multi-colored sideways '8'). Vista,7, run as Administrator.\n\n4. During installation it will ask you two important questions (besides the usual ones):\n\n   1-INSTALLATION: TYPICAL OR CUSTOM. Choose 'CUSTOM'.\n     On the panel that opens next choose 'SELECT ALL' and 'CONTINUE'.\n\n   2-REGISTER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: Check the square next to it and OK.\n\n5. After it is done with the installation, it will ask you for the MSDN Library.\n  Check the &quot;do not install msdn&quot;. It will complain, but continue.\n\n6. At the very end asks you to register with Microsoft. Do not (uncheck the square).\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6f631e945d08fc92495df1568fff71e9bc9a20e","amp;dn":"Visual+C%2B%2B+Compiler+%281998%29+Std+Edition.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6f631e945d08fc92495df1568fff71e9bc9a20e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,246,49,233,69,208,143,201,36,149,223,21,104,255,247,30,155,201,162,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
