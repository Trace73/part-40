The account of how that dream became reality unfolds in the stories of Jefferson and nine other Americans whose adventurous spirits and lust for land pushed the westward boundaries: Andrew Jackson, John Ã¢â‚¬Å“Johnny AppleseedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Chapman, David Crockett, Sam Houston, James K. Polk, Winfield Scott, Kit Carson, Nicholas Trist, and John Quincy Adams.\n\nTheir storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and those of the nameless thousands who risked their lives to settle on the frontier, displacing thou- sands of Native AmericansÃ¢â‚¬â€form an extraordinary chapter in American history that led directly to the cataclysm of the Civil War. Filled with illustrations, portraits, maps, battle plans, notes, and time lines, Lions of the West is a richly authoritative biography of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â€its ideals, its promise, its romance, and its destiny.\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9781616201890\nPublisher: Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill\nPublication date: 8/21/2012\n\nMeet the Author\nRobert Morgan is the author of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction, most notably his novel Gap Creek, and Boone, his biography of Daniel Boone, both of which were national bestsellers.
