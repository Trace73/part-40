It was released on July 4, 1990. The film was directed by Renny Harlin, and stars Bruce Willis as John McClane. The film co-stars Bonnie Bedelia (reprising her role as Holly McClane), William Sadler, Art Evans, William Atherton (reprising his role as Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Thornburg), Franco Nero, Dennis Franz, Fred Thompson, John Amos, and Reginald VelJohnson, returning briefly in his role as Sgt. Al Powell from the first film.\n\nThe screenplay was written by Steven E. de Souza and Doug Richardson, adapted from Walter Wager's novel 58 Minutes. The novel has the same premise but differs slightly: A cop must stop terrorists who take an airport hostage while his daughter's plane circles overhead. He has 58 minutes to do so before the plane crashes. Roderick Thorp, who wrote the bestselling novel Nothing Lasts Forever, upon which Die Hard was based, receives credit for creating &quot;certain original characters&quot;, although his name is misspelled onscreen as &quot;Roderick Thorpe&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47cd902ecb080b3e7768bb618942f6e5aef430ac","amp;dn":"Die+Hard+2+%5B1990%5D+DVD9+PAL+ENG+GER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47cd902ecb080b3e7768bb618942f6e5aef430ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,205,144,46,203,8,11,62,119,104,187,97,137,66,246,229,174,244,48,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
