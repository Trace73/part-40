Chilibeck and Taylor were also big Grateful Dead fans and somehow managed to corrupt the southern sensibilities of Hughes and Waisman and their own brand of original music was born. Soon after the band began playing the North Shore bar circuit, they were joined by transplanted easterer Jordan White on Keyboards and their long musical journey began. Over the next few years Waisman shared the drummers seat with Lonnie Powell and Darrell Stables but the band would find it's ultimate lineup with the addition of Geoff Hicks and Franco Diligenti. This roster would make two studio albums, 'Sparks Off The Guardrail' and 'Mule' and play countless shows from coast to coast.\n\nIn 1997 the touring grind, and difficulties with the bands third record would take it's toll on some members and the band called it quits for a while. After three years SSMB decided to start playing selective shows.\n\nAfter rediscovering their common thread the band continues to bring their original songs(old and new) and huge repetoire of covers to venues in Vancouver and Whistler. With a new licensing deal with Curve Records 'Sparks Off The Guardrail' and 'Mule' are available for the first time in years. \n\n\n\n\nSparks off the Guardrail 1992\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nSparks off the Guardrail\nGeorgia White\nStuck on the farm\nDraw the Line\nNot Bitter at All\nPablo Picasso\nStrength\nThe Spoken Word\nOh Mary\nThe Grinch Lives\nVicious Clippers\nSteel Guitars\nGreyhound Blues\n\n\n\n\n\nMule 1994\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nTwisted Vehicle\nRagged &amp; Rough\nRomance Flats\nColorado\nRum &amp; Whatever\nSmack Baby\nAngel on a Mule\nSpitting Down on the Sun\nNobodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Fool\nNot Gonna Make It\nThing of Beauty\nCharming\nWhere the Buffalo Roam\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87dc61a6e374c8ce1022023ea88aa91b3b45653c","amp;dn":"She+Stole+My+Beer+%282+albums%29+1992+-+1994+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87dc61a6e374c8ce1022023ea88aa91b3b45653c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,220,97,166,227,116,200,206,16,34,2,62,168,138,169,27,59,69,101,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
