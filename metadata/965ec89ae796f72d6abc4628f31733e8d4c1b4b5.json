Typically, an issue would be given over to clarifying the post-Crisis origins of a number of characters, usually two (as most of the issues were 'double-sized', i.e. 48 pages, plus ads). Roy Thomas was the initial writer/editorial consultant on the series; later issues were overseen by Mark Waid.\n\nAlso included is the original Secret Origins series from the early 70s, as well as several one-shots from 1960s and 1970s, 1990s.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:965ec89ae796f72d6abc4628f31733e8d4c1b4b5","amp;dn":"Secret+Origins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"965ec89ae796f72d6abc4628f31733e8d4c1b4b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,94,200,154,231,150,247,45,106,188,70,40,243,23,51,232,212,193,180,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
