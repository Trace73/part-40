The song was their second U.S. number one, topping the Billboard Hot 100 on 8 July 1989. It also peaked at #7 on the UK singles chart.\n\nThe song made its first appearance in the 1987 film Tin Men. Fine Young Cannibals portrayed a nightclub band in the movie, performing this song and three others (including the single's b-side &quot;Social Security&quot;). The film is set in Baltimore in 1963, and the song's retro-soul style is consistent with that setting.\n\nThis promo video features many scenes with motor scooters, both at rest and in motion as well as scooter culture. The scooters featured include stock scooters, as well as highly stylised scooters and minimalist cutdown scooters.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Thing_(song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Thing_(song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DabanAAdh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DabanAAdh&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:24\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
