Not a ronin but a rurouni, he was never a samurai, but an assassin of utmost skill in the Meiji restoration, who in the turning point of the war simply walked away. His travels lead him to Tokyo in the 11th year of the Meiji era, where he befriends a female Kendo master, a former thief, a brawler and a doctor all with their own secrets. Together they fight off the enemies surfacing from the dark past that Kenshin cannot escape. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4499c0334e75a9034c35f35264305fdcaba90632","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Rurouni+Kenshin+%281-94%29+Complete+%5B480p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4499c0334e75a9034c35f35264305fdcaba90632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,153,192,51,78,117,169,3,76,53,243,82,100,48,95,220,171,169,6,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
