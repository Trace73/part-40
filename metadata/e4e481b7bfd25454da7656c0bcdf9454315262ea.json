The Maya provide a particularly strong example of the ways in which the built and imaged environment are intentionally oriented relative to political, religious, economic, and other spatial constructs.\r\n\r\nIn examining space, the contributors of this volume demonstrate the core interrelationships inherent in a wide variety of places and spaces, both concrete and abstract. They explore the links between spatial order and cosmic order and the possibility that such connections have sociopolitical consequences. This book will prove useful not just to Mayanists but to art historians in other fields and scholars from a variety of disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, geography, and landscape architecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4e481b7bfd25454da7656c0bcdf9454315262ea","amp;dn":"Maya+Imagery%2C+Architecture+and+Activity+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4e481b7bfd25454da7656c0bcdf9454315262ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,228,129,183,191,210,84,84,218,118,86,192,188,223,148,84,49,82,98,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
