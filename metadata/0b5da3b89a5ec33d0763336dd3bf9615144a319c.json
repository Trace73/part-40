They are traveling as part of a bus tour group, but shortly after they leave home they suspect someone has been murdered. One of the detectives (Cy) forgets he is retired and tries to solve the murder of someone whose body has not yet been discovered, while his friend (Lou) must continually remind him that they are now retired. Cy tries to sneak and solve the murder without a body yet being discovered, while enjoying the first vacation he has taken in over thirty years. Humor and mystery abound.\n--Murder at the Book Fair (Book 8)\nWhen an aging coroner says a wealthy author died of natural causes and sees no need to do an autopsy, the county sheriff calls an old friend, retired homicide detective Cy Dekker, to see if the man was murdered. Cy gets a medical examiner friend to do an autopsy and finds that the man was poisoned and the time of death was probably when that author was at a book fair. Cy and his retired partner Lou look at who might have poisoned the man. Suspects include other authors, the author's brother and sister, and his neighbors.\n\n\nNote: More than most of the books that i have uploaded / will upload i BUY and share (unless it is not stated)..\nI bought these..\n\n\nPlease be aware that i want to seed 24h/d, however with a really old laptop, a connection of U:80.0 kB/s and multiple seeds \nsimultaneously my contribution will not be enough.
