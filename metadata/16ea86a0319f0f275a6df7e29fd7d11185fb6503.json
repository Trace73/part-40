Interesting enough, this crowd pleaser works quite well.\nDave The Dude (Ford) is a gangster on the verge of making a big deal. Dave is superstitious. He always must get an apple from that vagrant-looking Davis.\nDavis, as Apple Annie, was phenomenal in this film. She acts just like an old broken down bag-lady. She does it with a finesse. (Is it really possible to have a refined bag-lady, you bet it is.)\nAnyway, it appears that Davis has a daughter living abroad all these years. Ann-Margret is she and the latter thinks that her mother is high society. Trouble now is that Ann is getting engaged to a count and they're coming to New York to look mom over. Dave and his girlfriend, Lange, fix up Davis to make her look like a dowager. They even provide a husband for her-Thomas Mitchell!\nAs if this isn't funny enough, we have Peter Falk, in a truly worthy Oscar nominated supporting performance, as Dave's sidekick who can't fathom what is going on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ea86a0319f0f275a6df7e29fd7d11185fb6503","amp;dn":"Pocketful+of+Miracles+%28Bette+Davis%2C+Glenn+Ford%2C+Hope+Lang%29+%5B1961","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ea86a0319f0f275a6df7e29fd7d11185fb6503","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,234,134,160,49,159,15,39,90,109,247,226,159,215,209,17,133,251,101,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
