We begin by evaluating the default paint effects library and how to convert the strokes into renderable geometry with mia Materials. Using Physical Sun/Sky, we create more photorealistic renders through the creation of our own materials in a tonemapped workflow circumventing the default shaders created by Paint Effects. Everything necessary to create double sided shaders with realistic glossy reflections and translucency is demonstrated in detail. We look at mapping all relevant paramaters for more believable shaders via diffuse, bump, reflection and translucency, including how to organize UVs into tiles for variety in our leaf textures. We take an in-depth look at creating ivy with Paint Effects and the Ivy Generator tool and incorporate the discussed techniques for plants and ivy into a cliff scene. All relevant Paint Effects settings are then discussed so that we can create our own custom plant library, all of which culminates in a photorealistic forest trail. We create a variety of plants from scratch including ferns, ground cover clover, spider plants and more, demonstrating how to incorporate them into a complex environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are on FaceBook, Post Your Request, suggestion, and find upcomming Release of Silver RG, you will find all Silver RG Encoders at FB Page so keep in touch\n\n\n\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All SilverTorrentHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member,A video sample is included in the folder for those who want to check quality and compatibility before downloading the whole movie.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers \n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say&quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb74b992dcd316def2bf590b25e6499beeb6d44c","amp;dn":"Creating+Plants+in+Maya+Mental+Ray_Forest+Techniques+Part+1+HD+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb74b992dcd316def2bf590b25e6499beeb6d44c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,116,185,146,220,211,22,222,242,191,89,11,37,230,73,155,238,182,212,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
