The piece, which can be described as a collage of melody, text and samplings, has struck like a bombshell in many of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s major cities.\n\n\n1. Chaconne - Canterloops\n2.

The work was inspired partly by texts, but also by drawings, structures and sounds, the juxtaposition of orchestra and sampler playing a considerable role because of the latter&amp;#039;s ability to store sounds and noises ordinarily alien to orchestral sonorities. The associations I have are with a realistic, certainly contradictory, but ultimately positive image of the modern city. My intention was not to produce a close-up but to try and read the city as a text and then to translate something of its mechanics and architecture into music...\nWhen it comes to the power dynamics of the city, the individual is always the more vulnerable party. Art rebels against this overpowering structure by strengthening the subjective element. Music, too, is composed from a highly subjective perspective, for composers usually justify what they write by saying that they &quot;need to get it out of their system&quot;. That is only partly true for me. I try to gain a bit more distance. I construct something that confronts the audience and the audience reacts to it, discovering in the music a space they can enter complete with their associations and ideas.\n(From a conversation with Heiner Goebbels)\n\n\nThe opening ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSuite for Sampler and OrchestraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ incorporates ambient urban sounds of Berlin, New York, Tokyo, Lyon and St Petersburg, and mixes industrial sounds with baroque quotations, and emotionally engaging cantorial singing from the Jewish tradition.\n\nAs ever with Goebbels, literary quotations and text-setting have an important role to play in this music. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Horatian - Three SongsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features words (adaptations of LivyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s account of the struggle be-tween Rome and Alba ) by the late East German dramatist and fierce social critic Heiner MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller, who was GoebbelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ most frequent artistic collaborator for 15 years. MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ller on GoebbelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ work: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWith illiteracy on the rise, with books being printed faster than they are written and bought more than they are read, with the theatre increasingly inundating texts with images, robbing them of their subversive quality as it flails blindly to defend itself against television, with reality increasingly being replaced by more or less manipulated or manipulative reproductions of reality, Heiner Goebbels proposes a new form of reading, a different, no longer touristic approach to the landscape of a text.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn The Country of Last ThingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ takes its text from author Paul AusterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s apocalyptic novel which describes a city ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œin a terminal state of collapseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, where ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdeath has replaced the business of lifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œD &amp; CÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, for orchestra, is in part inspired by Franz KafkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s story ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe City Coat of ArmsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAll the legends and songs that came to birth in that city are filled with longing for a prophesied day when the city would be destroyed by five successive blows from a gigantic fist. It is for that reason too that the city has a closed fist on its coat of arms.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½)\n\nAnd ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurrogateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has words by Hugo Hamilton, the Irish-German writer of GoebbelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ generation who similarly carves a path between high art and popular forms. Indeed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurrogate CitiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has the curious distinction of being one of the most experimental of GoebbelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ works and also ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at least in parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ his most accessible project to date, with sections clearly destined for multi-format radio play. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe HoratianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the Country of Last ThingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ feature the voice of soul-jazz singer Jocelyn B. Smith, well known for her contributions to the soundtracks of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Lion KingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHotel ShanghaiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and for her hit album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBlue Lights and NylonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Free improviser David Moss, whose numerous credits include work with Bill LaswellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Material and Carla BleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s revived ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEscalator Over The HillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, is the singer on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSurrogateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and also adds his idiosyncratic vocals to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the Country of Last ThingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c66bf2a78b16817bb3af17546d9961bbad39850","amp;dn":"Heiner+Goebbels+-+Surrogate+Cities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c66bf2a78b16817bb3af17546d9961bbad39850","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,102,191,42,120,177,104,23,187,58,241,117,70,217,150,27,186,211,152,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
