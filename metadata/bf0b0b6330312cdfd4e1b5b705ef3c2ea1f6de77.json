But the reason for splitting isn't itself shocking: theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re &quot;just not in love any more.&quot; The announcement sparks a week long Loony family reunion at Maggie and David's creepy (and possibly haunted) beach house.\n\nThe eldest child, Dennis, struggles with his parents' decision while facing difficulties of his own in his recent marriage. Believing that his parents are hiding the true reasons behind their estrangement, Dennis embarks on a quest to discover the truth and searches through clues, trap doors, and secret tunnels in attempt to find an answer. Claire, the middle child, is a single mother whose 16-year-old daughter, Jill, is apathetic to the divorce but confounded by Claire and troubled by her own &quot;mannish&quot; appearance. The youngest child, Peter, is a hack filmmaker suffering from paralyzing insecurities who establishes an unorthodox romance with a mysterious day care counselor at the beach.\n\nIn a six-day period rich with atmospheric sequences, these characters stumble blindly around one another, often ignoring their surroundings and consumed by their own daily conflicts. Visually, Shaw employs a leisurely storytelling pace that allows room for exploring the interconnecting relationships among the characters and plays to his strength as a cartoonist Ã¢â‚¬â€ small gestural details and nuanced expressions that bring the characters to vivid and intimate life.\n\nFor anyone who cares, here's my release thread, I'll be posting all of my torrents there:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-dfblast-s-Hipster-Comics&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0b0b6330312cdfd4e1b5b705ef3c2ea1f6de77","amp;dn":"Bottomless+Belly+Button+%282008%29+%28Nweako%29+%5BBy+Dash+Shaw%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0b0b6330312cdfd4e1b5b705ef3c2ea1f6de77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,11,11,99,48,49,44,223,212,225,181,183,5,239,60,46,161,246,222,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
