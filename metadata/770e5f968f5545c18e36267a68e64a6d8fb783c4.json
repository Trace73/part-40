To maintain       \n    this status it desperately needed better ways of         \n    looking after its sick and wounded, so in 1746 it         \n    decided to build the best hospital the country had ever    \n    seen, near the Portsmouth dockyard at Haslar. Costing     \n    100,000, it was the biggest construction project in     \n    the country, and for over 250 years Haslar treated        \n    sailors from The Battle of Trafalgar to the Gulf War,      \n    until in 2009 the hospital closed its doors on the sick   \n    for the last time. Between 1757 and 1826, thousands of   \n    seamen and marines of the Royal Navy are believed to      \n    have been buried in a Navy-designed cemetery in a field    \n    beside the hospital. Exactly how and where they were      \n    buried is not known and, as part of the closure          \n    programme, the cemetery has to be excavated, to find      \n    out where the burials are and how many there might be.     \n    Time Team followed the archaeologists as they uncovered   \n    multiple burials and carefully analysed the remains,     \n    providing extraordinary insight into what life was like   \n    in the Georgian Navy. There were no headstones and no      \n    records, but painstaking research built a picture of      \n    how and why the men ended up anonymously buried at       \n    Nelson's hospital.                                        \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                                  \n      \n\n      \n            .  . ..: RiPPER/RELEASE NOTES :.. .  .           \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n                                                              \n                                                               \n                                                              \n                                                             \n      \n\n                                             \n                  ..: GROUP NEWS/CONTACT :..  \n                                                           \n                                                      \n       SFM is dedicated to bringing you high quality     \n      TVRips and DVDRips of popular series and movies for   \n                     your viewing pleasure!                 \n                                                           \n       We are currently looking for:                       \n       - 100+ Mbit EU dump site for exclusive SFM usage   \n       - HDTV/PDTV cappers                                \n       - Crates &amp; Kegs of Beer (full of course)          \n                                                         \n                  .  . ..: GREETZ :.. .  .","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:770e5f968f5545c18e36267a68e64a6d8fb783c4","amp;dn":"A.Time.Team.Special.S17.Nelsons.Hospital.WS.PDTV.XviD-SFM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"770e5f968f5545c18e36267a68e64a6d8fb783c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,14,95,150,143,85,69,193,142,54,38,122,104,230,74,109,143,183,131,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
