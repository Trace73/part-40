It was released on March 11, 1977, and reached a chart peak in the\nUK of #26. It was the band's highest-charting album since 1974's Zinc Alloy and\nthe Hidden Riders of Tomorrow.\n\nAt the time of the album's release Marc Bolan and T.Rex were on a UK tour,\nsupported by The Damned. The album and tour were notable for marking a return\nto form for the band. Dandy in the Underworld gathered the most consistently\npositive reviews for any T.Rex album in five years. Having fallen from critical and\ncommercial favour the band had endured some fiercely hostile press but NME,\nwho had been amongst the most negative, noted of the album: &quot;very listenable,\nwell arranged immaculately played.&quot;\n\nThe sessions had started in Los Angeles in August 1976 and carried on until the\nend of the year, in UK studios \n\n\n\n \nAll songs written and composed by Marc Bolan.\n\n\n   1. &quot;Dandy in the Underworld&quot; ~ 4:33\n   2. &quot;Crimson Moon&quot; ~ 3:22\n   3. &quot;Universe&quot; ~ 2:43\n   4. &quot;I'm a Fool For You Girl&quot; ~ 2:16\n   5. &quot;I Love to Boogie&quot; ~ 2:14\n   6. &quot;Visions of Domino&quot; ~ 2:23\n   7. &quot;Jason B.
