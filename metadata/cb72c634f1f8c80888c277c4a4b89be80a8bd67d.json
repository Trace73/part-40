Everything you need in one package to compose, arrange, record, edit, mix and master professional quality music.\n\nWhat's new?\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Rename window empty for FX plugins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Effect names too long in extra wide view in mixer\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Zipped channels cut off when resizing in mini PR view\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Added track name and/or plugin name to automation clip names\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Don't allow adding a track if there's anything on track 199 of the playlist\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed resizing of step sequencer when hiding/showing mixer track selectors\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fixed default filter in sample open dialogs\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Dashboard: removed mixer track selector in channel rack\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Delay Bank: Param reset on load\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Edison: doesn't save sample filename as unicode\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fruity Send: fixed threading issue\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Fruity Slicer: crash when trying to use elastique\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Keyboard Splitter: velocity not correct for VST plugins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Keyboard Splitter: removed popup from manual mapping button\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Newtone: abstract error when resizing editor\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patcher: &quot;midi in&quot; plugins now receive untranslated midi data as sent by other plugin\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patcher: pitch applied twice to VST plugins\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patcher: pitch difference when played through Flowstone\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Patcher: can't drop channel preset\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Vocodex: crash when selecting &quot;Machine 2&quot; synthesizer preset\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wave Traveller: crash changing preset from preview keyboard (x64)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Wrapper: sometimes shows editor with size of options window\n\nNFO:\nThis patch activates all features of FL Studio 12.1 Beta 2 including all internal plugins.\nIf you owned a legal copy of FL Studio 12 using your legit FLRegKey, this crack/installer\nwon't affect your key or registration name. It just additionally activates all features of the\nSignature Bundle and all included Instruments &amp; Effects - no matter what version\nyou've bought.\n\nNote:\nThe crack also removes the expiration date of August 26th 2015.\n(means you can use this beta as long as you want)\n\nInstaller-Info:\nBecause of the massive compression of the installer, it could take some seconds to load\non lower machines but I also added a lower compressed installer for all who got problems\ninstalling the crack. Optional included are my dark blue colored FL Studio 12.1 Splash\nScreens &amp; Icons for those, who don't like the original stuff (like me).\n\nIf you want to reset these icons later (make sure to select 'Backup original files'\nin the installer), go to the installation path of FL12.1 Beta 2\n[C:Program Files (x86)Image-LineFL Studio 12.1 beta]\nand look inside of the dir 'r4e'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb72c634f1f8c80888c277c4a4b89be80a8bd67d","amp;dn":"Image-Line+FL+Studio+v.12.1+Beta+2+Signature+Bundle-r4e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb72c634f1f8c80888c277c4a4b89be80a8bd67d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,114,198,52,241,248,200,8,136,194,119,196,164,184,155,232,10,139,214,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
