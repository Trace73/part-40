Diodo - 3:48\n2. Metamorphosis - 2:59\n3. Microchaos - 2:43\n4. Compression - 2:46\n5. Equilibrium - 4:00\n6. Dipnoi - 2:50\n7. Distillation - 3:44\n8. Violence - 3:08\n9. Equivalence - 2:35\n10.Psycho-Nebulous - 4:53\n11.Uncle Jim (Bonus track) - 2:46\n\nThis legendary 1971 album was recorded by unknown musicians in Milan, for use as incidental music in films, television and radio. Almost each and every track is a short, heavy acid rock symphony ... Disturbing, dissonant, and even downright menacing. An astounding blend of creepy grooves and distorted guitar, it was released in tiny numbers in Italy, France and the UK, and is highly sought-after by collectors today. This welcome reissue comes complete with the only other track released under the Blue Phantom name.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8453e82a5412bd6c4575609659e73b0133dc54e","amp;dn":"Blue+Phantom+-+Distortions+%281971%2F2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8453e82a5412bd6c4575609659e73b0133dc54e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,69,62,130,165,65,43,214,196,87,86,9,101,158,115,176,19,61,197,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
