Against his will and his nature, he has long been considered-given his enormous size and strength-a goon and enforcer by his classmates, by his hockey coaches, and, not least, by his &quot;tiny, angry&quot; father. He gamely lives up to their expectations, until a vicious twist of fate forces him to flee underground. Now pushing 40, he discovers that an old, trusted friend from his college days has published a novel that borrows freely from the traumatic events of Rank's own life. Outraged by this betrayal and feeling cruelly misrepresented, he bashes out his own version of his story in a barrage of e-mails to the novelist that range from funny to furious to heartbreaking.\nWith The Antagonist, Lynn Coady demonstrates all of the gifts that have made her one of Canada's most respected young writers. Here she gives us an astonishing story of sons and fathers and mothers, of the rewards and betrayals of male friendship, and a large-spirited, hilarious, and exhilarating portrait of a man tearing his life apart in order to put himself back together.
