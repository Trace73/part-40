As such, Cremo called for the scientific community to admit this inherent bias or &quot;deal with everything that's possibly true about the world that we live in.&quot; With regards to his specific research into &quot;extreme human antiquity,&quot; he surmised that the resistance by the scientific community to his work is driven by power, money, and self-preservation.\n\nCremo detailed his recent trip to India which included visiting the &quot;Iron Pillar of Delhi&quot;:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_pillar_of_Delhi&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThis object, which has stood for about 3,000 years, is particularly perplexing because it has not corroded over time. Given that it should have been reduced to a pile of rust by now, Cremo surmised that the pillar is strong evidence that &quot;people before modern times did have some pretty advanced technological knowledge.&quot; He also talked about visiting a huge mountain in southern India that was composed of one solid rock. &quot;It's like somebody just dropped a huge boulder,&quot; he marveled. According to Cremo, the sides of the mountain contain &quot;cave temples&quot; honoring ancient deities and the local priests told him that it dates back far into antiquity.\n\nHe also shared a story, from Kenya, of footprints that were identical to those of humans and found in layers of rock approximately 1.5 million years old. According to mainstream science, these footprints could not possibly be made by homo sapiens, so scientists attributed the footprints to an &quot;ape man&quot; that would have existed at the time. However, Cremo explained, fossil evidence shows that human beings are the only species with that specific kind of foot. &quot;For those who accept the dominant theory today, it is mind boggling, because it puts human beings like us ten times older than most scientists now think possible,&quot; he mused. If these footprints were merely one anomalous find, then it could be dismissed, Cremo said, but &quot;there are hundreds of cases like this that I have documented in my work.&quot;\n\nMortgage Deal\n\nIn the first hour, investment advisor Catherine Austin Fitts responded to the proposed mortgage deal:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.legalnewsline.com/news/235153-more-than-40-states-have-signed-on-to-proposed-mortgage-deal&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.legalnewsline.com/news/235153-more-than-40-states-have-signed-on-to-proposed-mortgage-deal&lt;/a&gt;\n\nas well as other happenings with the U.S. economy.&quot;I hate to see it used as a PR excuse that homeowners are being helped when I just don't believe that's the case,&quot; Fitts lamented about the deal. She attributed her skepticism to the fact that it ultimately does not address the fundamentally broken economic system in America which, she observed, is burdened by a &quot;culture of arrogance by the big banks.&quot; Regarding how the economy could influence the presidential race, Fitts suggested that, by design, more difficult economic developments are being staved off until after the election.\n\nNews segment guests: Douglas Hagmann &amp; Neil Slade\n\nWebsite(s):\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mcremo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mcremo.com&lt;/a&gt;\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forbiddenarcheology.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forbiddenarcheology.com&lt;/a&gt;\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://solari.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://solari.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBook(s):\n\nHuman Devolution\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892133341/c2cam-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892133341/c2cam-20&lt;/a&gt;\n\nForbidden Archeology\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892132949/c2cam-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0892132949/c2cam-20&lt;/a&gt;\n\t\nForbidden Archeologist\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Forbidden-Archeologist-Atlantis-Magazine-Columns/dp/0892133376/c2cam-20&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Forbidden-Archeologist-Atlantis-Magazine-Columns/dp/0892133376/c2cam-20&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBecome A Coast Insider:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.coasttocoastam.com/coastinsider&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.coasttocoastam.com/coastinsider&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c1d40015ac3d087fd80499c263bfd0a834ba130","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+2012.02.08+Forbidden+Archaeology+%26amp%3B+Science","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c1d40015ac3d087fd80499c263bfd0a834ba130","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,29,64,1,90,195,208,135,253,128,73,156,38,59,253,10,131,75,161,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
