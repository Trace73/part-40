It all got started in August 2005 with &quot;Gutter Phenomenon&quot;. Then having that same album named &quot;Record Of The Year&quot; by Revolver Magazine.\n\nWhen 2006 came around, they started off the year by touring the US with Story Of The Year and the UK with My Chemical Romance (remember that Gerard from MCR is a guest singer on &quot;Gutter&quot;). To top it all off, they were named of the &quot;Breakout bands of WARPED TOUR 2006&quot; by tour organizer, Kevin Lyman.\n\nSo with over 75,000 records sold, Every Time I Die is now taking over the airwaves and venues in a city near you. Their new video, &quot;The New Black&quot; has been added to FUSE, MTV2 and Music Choice.\n\nNow, in celebration of these past two years (hell, their whole career), the band is bringing you their debut DVD, &quot;Shit Happens&quot; this Halloween. The DVD is chockfull of footage showing the band at their best (on stage) and their worst (setting their hair on fire). Basically, it is a must have for any Every Time I Die fan - or any fan of some goddamn good music!\n\nDVD FEATURES\n*2+ hours of one-of-a-kind ETID footage\n*Ridiculous amounts of LIVE songs shot around the US\n*Scandalous Hidden Extras\n*Never Before Seen &quot;Behind The Scenes&quot; footage from their US tour, their Buffalo Christmas show, and the Warped Tour.\n*Raucous home videos\n*Academy Award Winning music videos\n*And of course, the directorial genius of High Roller Studio&amp;#039;s Doug Spangenberg.\n\nTRACK LIST:\nIntro\nGet Warped\nETID\nShinfo about Shinfo\nPass Out Game\nStreet team part 1\nKeith hearts lindsay\nDay off cinema\nFamily\nShoplifting Shinfo\nKeith&amp;#039;s Krib\nBuffalo TV Party\nFootball Shinfo\nAcey Deucey\n&quot;Sour Scittles are too ironic&quot;\nLurker\nSports\nJizz Mayo\nBarfabalooza\nSneaker Shinfo\nSignings\nJordan Hearts Kate\nI Been Gone a Long Time\n&quot;We&amp;#039;re Here to Relieve the Hurricane&quot;\nStreet Team part 2\nDurst (An Ode to Stank)\nJordan&amp;#039;s Shirt Shinfo\nSketchy Coaster\nThe New Black\nMan Stuff\nFloater\nJager Babe\nMonster Mosh\nTech Beef\nGetting Ready for the Xmas Show\nGloom and How it Gets That Way\nThis Probably Could Have Been Cut\nJapan\nStreet Team part 3\nYour Momma&amp;#039;s A Redneck\nNo one Could Ever Love Joey\nSic Tats\nTeacher Shinfo\nNo Diving\nBored Stiff\nA Ton of Tonawanda Shinfo\nI will always love you\nChamping at the Bit\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ll box anyone on this tour&quot;\nFlaming Mohawk\nThe Van Flip\nBoogers\nPretty Dirty\nThe Brittany Equation Show\nClosing out the Xmas Buffalo Show\nBuilding Shinfo\nApocalypse Now and Then\nDon&amp;#039;t Call Him Ratboy\n3 was better\nKill the Music\nRotisserie Gold\nOutro\nCredits ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2e32961c2fe285cb921cc2514006c9cce9320d","amp;dn":"Every+Time+I+Die+-+Shit+Happens+DVD+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2e32961c2fe285cb921cc2514006c9cce9320d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,46,50,150,28,47,226,133,203,146,28,194,81,64,6,201,204,233,50,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
