So this collection has 16 years of World title fights in the middleweight division, All in a Spoiler-Free chronological order (more or less). There are 20 disks in total.\n\n\nEven though I set out to make this a spoiler-free set.....I have named the next few disks &quot;The Marvin Hagler Years&quot;.\n\n I have done this because the man is a 'Legend of Boxing' and deserves to have his title reign acknowledged! I have also done this because I had not yet come across a Hagler set that had these fights in chronological order. I have left the menu with a similar design to continue the theme ( dates instead of names ) but I have added a picture of The Marvelous One, this is for the benefit of the members who grab these disks for the Hagler content only ( these members should take note that Hagler appears on both previous disks ).\n\n The idea behind this set is that if you download each disk in order: You will be able to watch every single Middleweight Title fight in the correct order and without spoilers ( This is for the benefit of any members who have not seen the fights and do not know the results ).\n\nThis collection includes all WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO Middleweight title fights from 1980 to 1993. Some British and European title fights feature along with a few eliminator bouts.....if my memory serves me correctly! Enjoy.\n\n\nThis is Disk 3 of 20:\n\nNot all the disks in this collection are NTSC and some are Dual-Layer (DVD9).\n\nWatch history in the making as titles change hands and real legends of the ring are born. All bouts on this disk are for the WBA &amp; WBC Middleweight titles:\n\nMenu Screenshot:\n\n[URL=https://imageshack.com/i/b59vfxj][IMG]http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/1024x768q90/401/9vfx.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n\n\nBout One: 13th June 1981: Vito Antuofermo Vs.
