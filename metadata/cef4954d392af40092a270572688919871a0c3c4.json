In addition to articles surveying Islamic, Chinese, Native American, Aboriginal Australian, Indian, Egyptian, and Tibetan medicine, the book includes essays on comparing Chinese and western medicine and religion and medicine. The essays address the connections between medicine and culture and relate the medical practices to the cultures which produced them. Each essay is well illustrated and contains an extensive bibliography. Because the geographic range is global, the book fills a gap in both the history of medicine and in cultural studies. It should find a place on the bookshelves of advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and scholars, as well as in libraries serving those groups.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef4954d392af40092a270572688919871a0c3c4","amp;dn":"Medicine+Across+Cultures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef4954d392af40092a270572688919871a0c3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,244,149,77,57,42,244,0,146,162,112,87,38,136,145,152,113,160,195,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
