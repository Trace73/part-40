Sheila suspects it was due to a patient Johnny referred to in his notes only as the eponymous &quot;N.&quot;\n\nIn the inner circle of the narrative, N. is diagnosed by Dr. John Bonsaint as suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoid delusions related to &quot;keeping balance&quot;. N. has become convinced that a circle of stones in a field on the outskirts of a nearby town, Ackerman's Field, contains a doorway to another reality, where a terrifying monster, repeatedly said to be a &quot;helmet-headed&quot; being named Cthun, is trying to break through. N.'s obsession eventually leads to his death by suicide, despite Johnny's best efforts. When Johnny goes out to the field to see the stones for himself, he begins to suspect that N. might not have been delusional after all when he suffers from the same symptoms as his patient.\n\nThe series consists of 25 one and a half-minute episodes totaling approximately 30 minutes in length. Featuring sophisticated production values, the episodes were drawn by artist Alex Maleev and colored by comic-book colorist JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Villarrubia,  with animation and production by motion graphics studio Motherland, Inc. They were adapted by Marc Guggenheim with creative oversight from Stephen King. The episodes are presented in a cutout animation format, complete with comic bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“style graphics, an original score, sound effects, and a full cast of voiceovers that includes actor Ben Shenkman.\n\nENJOY AND SEED...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df4bf9a1d876ed1f047e0c245748a1a42bef7dcc","amp;dn":"STEPHEN+KING+-+%26quot%3BN.%26quot%3B+%28+motion+comic+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df4bf9a1d876ed1f047e0c245748a1a42bef7dcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,75,249,161,216,118,237,31,4,126,12,36,87,72,161,164,43,239,125,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
