This book contains innovative perspectives and approaches to classic topics and problems in forensic medicine, offering reflections about the potential and limits of emerging areas in forensic expert research; it transmits the experience of some countries in the domain of cutting-edge expert intervention, and shows how research in other fields of knowledge may have very relevant implications for this practice.\n\n\n\nPublisher: InTech\n \n382 pages   (2011)\n\nEnglish \n\nISBN: 9533072623","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11ecf2a815a310bf81256364bcf076009594d216","amp;dn":"Forensic+Medicine%3AFrom+Old+Problems+to+New+Challenges%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11ecf2a815a310bf81256364bcf076009594d216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,236,242,168,21,163,16,191,129,37,99,100,188,240,118,0,149,148,210,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
