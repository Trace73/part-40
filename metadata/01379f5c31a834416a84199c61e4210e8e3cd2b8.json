Wells&amp;#039; War of the Worlds had been on Paramount Pictures&amp;#039; docket since the \nsilent era, when it was optioned as a potential Cecil B. DeMille production. \nWhen Paramount finally got around to a filming the Wells novel, the property was \nfirmly in the hands of special-effects maestro George Pal. Like Orson Welles&amp;#039; \ninfamous 1938 radio adaptation, the film eschews Wells&amp;#039; original Victorian \nEngland setting for a contemporary American locale, in this case Southern \nCalifornia. A meteorlike object crash-lands near the small town of Linda Rosa. \nAmong the crowd of curious onlookers is Pacific Tech scientist Gene Barry, who \nstrikes up a friendship with Ann Robinson, the niece of local minister Lewis \nMartin. Because the meteor is too hot to approach at present, Barry decides to \nwait a few days to investigate, leaving three townsmen to guard the strange, \nglowing object. Left alone, the three men decide to approach the meterorite, and \nare evaporated for their trouble. It turns out that this is no meteorite, but an \ninvading spaceship from the planet Mars. The hideous-looking Martians utilize \nhuge, mushroomlike flying ships, equipped with heat rays, to pursue the helpless \nearthlings. When the military is called in, the Martians demonstrated their \nruthlessness by &quot;zapping&quot; Ann&amp;#039;s minister uncle, who&amp;#039;d hoped to negotiate a \npeaceful resolution to the standoff. As Barry and Ann seek shelter, the Martians \ngo on a destructive rampage. Nothing-not even an atom-bomb blast-can halt the \nMartian death machines. The film&amp;#039;s climax occurs in a besieged Los Angeles, \nwhere Barry fights through a crowd of refugees and looters so that he may be \nreunited with Ann in Earth&amp;#039;s last moments of existence. In the end, the Martians \nare defeated not by science or the military, but by bacteria germs-or, to quote \nH.G. Wells, &quot;the humblest things that God in his wisdom has put upon the earth.&quot; \nForty years&amp;#039; worth of progressively improving special effects have not dimmed \nthe brilliance of George Pal&amp;#039;s War of the Worlds. Even on television, Pal&amp;#039;s \nOscar-winning camera trickery is awesome to behold. So indelible an impression \nhas this film made on modern-day sci-fi mavens that, when a 1988 TV version of \nWar of the Worlds was put together, it was conceived as a direct sequel to the \n1953 film, rather than a derivation of the Wells novel or the Welles radio \nproduction.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01379f5c31a834416a84199c61e4210e8e3cd2b8","amp;dn":"The+War+Of+The+Worlds+%28Byron+Haskin%2C+1953%29+%28Remastered%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01379f5c31a834416a84199c61e4210e8e3cd2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,55,159,92,49,168,52,65,106,132,25,156,97,228,33,14,142,60,210,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
