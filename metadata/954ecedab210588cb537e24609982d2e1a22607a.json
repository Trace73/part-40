The author presents a thought-provoking depiction of the sociopolitical environment in which some of the most prominent scientists in history lived and then provides a mathematical account of their contributions.\nFrom Eudoxus to Einstein, this fascinating book describes how, beginning in ancient times, pioneers in the sciences and mathematics have dramatically changed our vision of who we are as well as our place in the universe. Readers will discover how Ptolemy's geocentric model evolved into Kepler's heliocentric model, with Copernicus as the critical intermediary. The author explains how one scientific breakthrough set the stage for the next one, and he also places the scientists and their discoveries within the context of history, including:\nArchimedes, Apollonius, and the Punic Wars\nPtolemy and the rise of Christianity\nCopernicus and the Renaissance\nKepler and the Counter-Reformation\nNewton and the Enlightenment\nEinstein and the detonation of the atom bomb\nEach chapter presents the work of a single scientist or mathematician, building on the previous chapters to demonstrate the evolutionary process of discovery. Chapters begin with a narrative section and conclude with a mathematical presentation of one of the scientist's original works. Most of these mathematical presentations, including the section on Einstein's special relativity, are accessible using only basic mathematics; however, readers can skip the mathematical sections and still follow the evolution of science and mathematics.\nShifting the Earth is an excellent book for anyone interested in the history of mathematics and how the quest to understand the motion of the heavens has influenced the broader history of humankind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:954ecedab210588cb537e24609982d2e1a22607a","amp;dn":"Shifting+the+Earth%3A+The+Mathematical+Quest+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"954ecedab210588cb537e24609982d2e1a22607a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,78,206,218,178,16,88,140,181,55,226,70,9,152,45,46,26,34,96,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
