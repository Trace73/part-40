For an answer one must look at the history of black, for it is clear that over the last 1000 years there have been successive expansions in the wearing of black - from the Church to the Court, from the Court to officials and the merchant class. Though the black fashion was often smart and elegant, the growth and extension of it were fed by several dark currents in Europe's history - in its politics, its asceticism, its religious warfare. It was only in the 19th century, however, that the black fashion fully came into its own; the most telling witnesses constantly saw connections between the taste for black and the forms of constraint with which European society regimented itself. Although the 20th century has aimed for new colours and a new direction, black has retained its authority as well as its associations with strength and cruelty. At the same time, black is still smart, and fashion keeps returning to black. It is, perhaps, the colour that has come to acquire the greatest, most significant range of meaning in history, and this book offers a detailed study.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Men-Black-Picturing-History-ebook/dp/B00BCJTYSC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374504740&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=men+in+black+harvey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Men-Black-Picturing-History-ebook/dp/B00BCJTYSC/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1374504740&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=men+in+black+harvey&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8c1bdc7c43ef7c2320da6ca3cc7af75cfb6991","amp;dn":"Men+in+Black+%28Picturing+History%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8c1bdc7c43ef7c2320da6ca3cc7af75cfb6991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,140,27,220,124,67,239,124,35,32,218,108,163,204,122,247,92,251,105,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
