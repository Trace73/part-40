It was released on their 1988 Sunshine on Leith album, and subsequently as a single. It has become one of their most popular songs, reaching #11 in the UK charts and No. 1 on the Australian ARIA Charts in 1989, plus, five years later, #3 in the US Billboard Hot 100. The song has become a live staple at their concerts. The Proclaimers played it at Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push, the final concert of Live 8 at Murrayfield Stadium on 6 July 2005, to symbolise the conclusion of The Long Walk To Justice.\n\n\nThe song is popular in Scotland, where, at Hampden Park, every time the national football team scores, the song is played and sung along to by Scotland fans.\n\n\n&quot;I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the 1993 film Benny &amp; Joon. As a result the original music video was re-edited with clips from the film.\n\n\n\nThe song was also the theme song for the Swedish TV-show, High Chaparall. It also features in the How I Met Your Mother episode Arrivederci, Fiero, as the song stuck in the tape player of Marshall Eriksen's Pontiac Fiero between 1994 and 2007.\n\n\n\n                      ***I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).***\n\n\n                                  Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f38a4398d0d718b1d6c9249339b9b5581f80dbf4","amp;dn":"The+Proclaimers%28I%5C%27m+Gonna+Be%29500+Miles%281988%29-Wushan.AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f38a4398d0d718b1d6c9249339b9b5581f80dbf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,138,67,152,208,215,24,177,214,201,36,147,57,185,181,88,31,128,219,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
