As police officers, work is serious and coming home to cook is a good relaxer for these two.\r\nHow did you end up on MKR?\r\nMonique: I said to Sarah, â€œYouâ€™re a good cook arenâ€™t you?â€ And she said, â€œYeah Iâ€™m a good cook.â€ â€œGood, do you want to do MKR with me?â€ And so we filled out the application in our lunch break.\r\nHow long have you been work mates?\r\nMonique: Itâ€™s a very young relationship. Weâ€™d only been working together about three months when we applied for the show. Weâ€™ve known of each other for about four years. We bonded in a very male-dominated workplace - Sarah and I enjoyed each otherâ€™s femininities and our beautiful smells, our perfumes and eating healthily surrounded by all the boy smells.\r\nWho taught you how to cook?\r\nSarah: I remember growing up my mum Cheryl saying, â€œSarah you need to come into the kitchen, you need to see this, you need to know this one day.â€ Her big thing is you donâ€™t throw out anything. As a kid I was just like, â€œWhatever Mum.â€ When I got a bit older, from maybe 16 onwards, I started to develop a bit of an interest in what she was doing and I wanted to watch and by the time I had almost moved out of home, I had a really big interest and started looking at the different aspects of food and the healthy side of food.\r\nMonique: Iâ€™m half-Dutch and half-Maltese and I come from a very big family. Anytime we would go to a family function it was all about the food. If you rocked up to my nonaâ€™s house and said you werenâ€™t hungry thatâ€™s unheard of, of course youâ€™re hungry, youâ€™re always hungry. Sheâ€™s my main inspiration. I have a picture of her on the fridge - she looks over me cooking every day.\r\nWhat style of food will you be cooking?\r\nMonique: Weâ€™re modern Australian but then Sarah has her family type of cooking (Italian Polish) and I have my family cooking.\r\nWhat ingredients do you use a lot of?\r\nSarah: Butter, rosemary, a lot of garlic, onions, cream and a lot of vegetables as well.\r\nMonique: I like my protein and spices.\r\nAre you girly girls outside of the police force?\r\nSarah: Weâ€™re girly girls at work! Weâ€™re always like, â€œIs my hair ok, does my make-up look ok?â€\r\nMonique: We try to be as girly as we can. We canâ€™t wear jewellery, thatâ€™s an OH&amp;S thing, but we might put a nice little ribbon in our hair.\r\nHave you found the job as fulfilling as you thought it would be? \r\nMonique: I look at life very differently now, unfortunately, because of the things Iâ€™ve seen. It does change your view on life. It makes me appreciate what Iâ€™ve got, my husband, my children, my health and all the beautiful choices my parents made for me. Lifeâ€™s very tough and itâ€™s very easy for kids to go the wrong way very easily.\r\nHow do you cope under pressure?\r\nSarah: The pressure in the kitchen is a little bit different than the pressure out on the street at work. But we can grab some positivity from what we do at work and try and use it the same way to try and calm ourselves down. But when we first met Pete and Manu, we melted. That shocked me!\r\nHow competitive are you?\r\nMonique: Weâ€™re competitive within ourselves in that we want to do well and hopefully really knock them out of the water, at the same time we donâ€™t wish ill on someone else so that we can succeed.\r\nHow opinionated are you?\r\nMonique: Weâ€™re very honest because weâ€™re also representing the NSW Police; itâ€™s important within our work and what we do, to be honest people. We uphold the law, we are sworn to be truthful, so weâ€™re carrying that through to our experience with MKR. If we like something we say so and if we donâ€™t like something then unfortunately we donâ€™t like it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e94be23af8ced7f93a6adbe80ba44fd46537128","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s07e01.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e94be23af8ced7f93a6adbe80ba44fd46537128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,148,190,35,175,140,237,127,147,166,173,190,128,186,68,253,70,83,113,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
