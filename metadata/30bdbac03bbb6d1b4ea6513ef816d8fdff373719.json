Their short career of three records is exceptionally assembled in this compilation with 16 of their best, plus a live performance of the Beatles classic &quot;Let it be&quot; from their farewell gig in Sydney in 1992. Outstanding tracks from this cd are &quot;No Lies&quot;, &quot;Burning Feeling&quot;, &quot;Welcome To Tomorrow&quot; and the amazing &quot;Take You Higher&quot; duet with INXS' Michael Hutchence. This song is a valuable duet since Noiseworks lead singer Jon Stevens has been the voice of INXS from 2000 to 2004 and it is a thrill to hear a duet like this. Noiseworks never had the chance for an international success but this greatest hits is a must-have cd for those who reminisce the grandeur of rock bands in Australia in the '80's.\n\n\n\nAll tracks are encoded in FLAC format.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1.
