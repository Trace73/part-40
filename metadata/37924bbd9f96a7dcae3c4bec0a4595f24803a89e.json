So this is what happened\r\nThere are 3 bands with the name and one is from South America another from Germany and a third from the US. Its all Metal so enjoy.\r\n\r\n1. Post Mortem was an American death metal band, formed in 1982 in suburban Boston. They formed when the members of the band were still in high school. The band rehearsed every day, often rushing home to write music after classes. John McCarthy penned the personal songs while drummer Rick McIver wrote the gore lyrics. John Alexander helped write most of the songs. â€œOur whole concept was that we honestly didnâ€™t give a fuck. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re lumped in with punk rock as well as metal,â€ McCarthy said, adding: â€œItâ€™s much better to piss off people who think theyâ€™re pissed off than to piss off your grandma or your mother or your father.â€\r\n\r\n2.Postmortem is a German death metal band from Berlin.\r\nPostmortem was founded in 1991. After numerous live appearances (including complete tours with Crematory and Atrocity) and two demos, the band signed its first record deal, with Husky Records, and recorded Screams Of Blackness, which sold out[citation needed] and was re-released in 1998. After that, they played live again with Crematory and at a few large festivals (Death Comes in Lithuania with Hypocrisy, Bands Battle with Rammstein, and many more). After the Totmacher EP, the band changed labels after some disagreements and moved to Morbid Records.\r\n\r\n3.
