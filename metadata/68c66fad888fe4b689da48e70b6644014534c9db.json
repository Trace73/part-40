This is an unmodified Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Developer Edition ISO.  It needs no CD key and is full version.\n\nCheck the .nfo for details, I really doubt you'll need them though.  If you know what this program is and does, chances are you already know what you're doing.\n\nWarning:  This is 3GB.  Yes, it IS huge.  If you have a DreamSpark account, you can download this EXACT SAME ISO in half the time.  You've been warned.\n\nI'm not going through the bullshit of finding out the system requirements.  All I know is you need Windows XP SP2 or later and a fairly decent processor with a good amount of memory.  Good enough?  Good.  It's 4AM.\n\nThat said, here it is.  As promised.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68c66fad888fe4b689da48e70b6644014534c9db","amp;dn":"Microsoft.SQL.Server.2008.Developer.Edititon.DVD.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68c66fad888fe4b689da48e70b6644014534c9db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,198,111,173,136,143,228,182,137,218,72,231,11,102,68,1,69,52,201,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
