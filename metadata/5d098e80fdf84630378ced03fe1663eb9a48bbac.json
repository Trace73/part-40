Foster applies his much-loved combination of wit, know-how, and analysis to explain how each work has shaped our very existence as readers, students, teachers, and Americans. Foster illuminates how books such as The Last of the Mohicans, Moby-Dick, My Ãƒï¿½ntonia, The Great Gatsby, The Maltese Falcon, Their Eyes Were Watching God, On the Road, The Crying of Lot 49, and others captured an American moment, how they influenced our perception of nationhood and citizenship, and what about them endures in the American character. Twenty-five Books That Shaped America is a fun and enriching guide to America through its literature.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d098e80fdf84630378ced03fe1663eb9a48bbac","amp;dn":"Twenty-five+Books+That+Shaped+America+-+Thomas+C.+Foster","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d098e80fdf84630378ced03fe1663eb9a48bbac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,9,142,128,253,248,70,48,55,140,237,3,254,22,99,235,154,72,187,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
