These wonderfully robust tunes will set you jazzing for romance and hurly-burly speakeasy steppinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ out. Starting with the title track (Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Getting Myself Ready For YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a rare Cole Porter song originally recorded by Blanche Calloway - CabÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister), youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be rocking to the rafters and then Bear Hugging your baby.\nFrom there, the tunes roll into new stylistic water with steamy Riverboat shuffles and a hot southern style repertoire specifically designed for and being performed in intimate historic settings in the US. New to the mix, this break out trio featuring Janet Klein and her first Parlor Boy - John Reynolds whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s known for his expert whistling and hotter-than-hell guitar and banjo playing. John provided accompaniment on her 1st CD Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come Into My ParlorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and is joined with maestro violinist Benny Brydern (Hot Club Quartet) a Parlor Boy regular. This little threesome performs with tremendous drive and disarming simplicity.\nAlong with the swinging &amp; swaying thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dreamy romance tunes delivered with great arrangements and timeless lyrics by the sweet and vivacious Ms. Klein. The CD has plenty of variety with obscure movie tunes, a load of sassy Dixie mania, novelties and jazz age tales of bad behavior all mixed with a yummy plate of down home fun.\nThree songs feature Janet singing duets and harmonies with Parlor Fellows- John Reynolds (grandson of 20Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s 30Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s movie star Zazu Pitts), Ian Whitcomb (music historian and 60Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s pop star) and David Barlia (fellow ukulelian and eefing crooner). The CD is produced by Robert Loveless (of Scenic, 17 Pygmies &amp; Savage Republic) Also featured is Tom Marion member of Robert CrumbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cheap Suit Serenaders and Brad Kay, former member of The Original Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.\nThis is the 6th CD from the enchanting Ms Klein and her highly acclaimed, girdle-bustinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bunch of West Coast Jazz Archeologists.
