It runs off soon after, with Tamaki chasing after it. Soon Tamaki finds herself in a place where &quot;it doesn't feel like the world I came from.&quot; She gets attacked by three slime creatures, and a male comes charging in to save her - by clamping his hands around her body and mouth and telling her to be quiet.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f97e6fc829ed0531b76bb85663c35348f59defb","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Hiiro+no+Kakera+-+12+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f97e6fc829ed0531b76bb85663c35348f59defb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,151,230,252,130,158,208,83,27,118,187,133,102,60,53,52,143,89,222,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
