This makes itself clear with a noticeably increased classical influence, which keyboardist/organist Jon Lord was pushing for the most.\nThis era of the band has a bit of a reputation for being directionless, since no particular musical style really dominates among the mish-mash, but I find that it lends these early albums an eclecticism that, matched with the memberÃƒÂ¢??s superb individual chops and effortless interplay, makes these discs more inviting to listen to than their supposed later classics. Never a dull moment, even when small missteps occur.\nAfter a strange, tale-like, trippy half spoken-word opening track (ÃƒÂ¢??Listen, Learn, Read OnÃƒÂ¢??) and a thundering bluesy instrumental with a hypnotic groove (ÃƒÂ¢??Wring That NeckÃƒÂ¢?? --originally called ÃƒÂ¢??Hard RoadÃƒÂ¢?? in the US), we reach the albumÃƒÂ¢??s hit, a cover of Neil DiamondÃƒÂ¢??s ÃƒÂ¢??Kentucky Woman.ÃƒÂ¢?? Although it is the only song from The Book Of Taliesyn that has remained in the bandÃƒÂ¢??s repertoire, I find it to be the low point. ItÃƒÂ¢??s too normal to really fit in with its surroundings, being a straightforward pop song, and I find it melodically bland as well.\nThings really start to get interesting with the fusion of the galloping classical instrumental ÃƒÂ¢??ExpositionÃƒÂ¢?? (including BeethovenÃƒÂ¢??s funeral march from his Eroica symphony and massive timpani smashes) and a schizophrenic take on the BeatlesÃƒÂ¢?? ÃƒÂ¢??We Can Work It Out,ÃƒÂ¢?? complete with haunting, Bee Gee-like vocal harmonies and a fast, driving section that foreshadows ÃƒÂ¢??Highway StarÃƒÂ¢?? a few years early.\nNot content to merely sit back, the remaining three songs continue to raise the bar to epic proportions. The psychedelic, eerie, oddly arranged ÃƒÂ¢??ShieldÃƒÂ¢?? is a fantastically innovative mid-tempo gem unlike anything else in the Deep Purple catalogue. At one point, Blackmore even unleashes a surprisingly atonal solo more commonly found in the works of experimental prog-rock bands like King Crimson.\nAnother Deep Purple original, ÃƒÂ¢??AnthemÃƒÂ¢?? is a complex multi-part suite, starting with a minor key melancholic melody expertly delivered by EvansÃƒÂ¢?? smooth croon, followed by a gentle, hymn-like chorus. Unexpectedly, the middle section of the song consists of a Baroque organ and string quartet passage straight out of J.S. BachÃƒÂ¢??s playbook. An interesting layer is added when Blackmore adds some tasteful bluesy leads on top, creating quite an unusual mix.\nApparently, their thirst for bombast was not yet satiated, since the band ends the album with a near-symphonic, ten-minute cover of the Ike and Tina Turner classic ÃƒÂ¢??River Deep-Mountain High.ÃƒÂ¢?? Once again a massive, classically influenced intro, this time with a theme reminiscent of Richard StraussÃƒÂ¢?? Also Sprach Zarathustra, sets an ominous tone before a typically charging interpretation of the cover song grabs all the attention, with some impressively nimble bass work by Nick Simper.\nLike the debut, The Book Of Taliesyn is quite unlike the work that Deep Purple is known for today, but it is nevertheless a mostly excellent release by a young band determined to make its mark one way or another.
