How do they affect mind and body? Who uses them - and why?\n\nIn his search for food, early man tried all kinds of plants. Some nourished him, some, he found, cured his ills, and some killed him. A few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him into other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations - experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste - and occasionally several senses simultaneously are involved. The actual causes of such hallucinations are chemical substances in the plants. These substances are true narcotics.\n\nContrary to popular opinion, not all narcotics are dangerous and addictive. Strictly and etymologicolly speaking, a narcotic is any substance that has a depressive effect, whether slight or great, on the central nervous system.\n\nThis unique Golden Guide surveys the role of psychoactive plants in primitive and civilized societies from early times to the present. The first nontechnical guide to both the cultural significance and physiological effects of hallucinogens, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hallucinogenic PlantsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will fascinate general readers and students of anthropology and history as well as botanists and other specialists..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efef38fa0bdcde8739054a538053baf7b40268a8","amp;dn":"Hallucinogenic+Plants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efef38fa0bdcde8739054a538053baf7b40268a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,239,56,250,11,220,222,135,57,5,74,83,128,83,186,247,180,2,104,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
