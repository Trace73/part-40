You have to use a 32bit OS for it to correctly interface and recover the Media Smart Server. After it is recovered, do all the system downloads and then you will be able to use a 64bit OS to access the server.\n\n\nAnyone needing help with the Media Smart Server can get it at:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mediasmartserver.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mediasmartserver.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThey are a great community of Media Smart users.\n\n\nThanks to all and if this helps you, please seed for others!\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57129eb686ed13389148921ca5fe07093a753292","amp;dn":"HPMSSRecovery.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57129eb686ed13389148921ca5fe07093a753292","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,18,158,182,134,237,19,56,145,72,146,28,165,254,7,9,58,117,50,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
