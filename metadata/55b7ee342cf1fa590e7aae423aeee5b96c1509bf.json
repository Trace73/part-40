But before the jumpy journalists can dig up their bug story, they must first face the horrors of an extremely clumsy butler (Michael Richards), a nymphomaniac vampire (Geena Davis) and a semi-mad doctor (Joseph Bologna), as well as assorted mummies, werewolves and more Transylvania oddballs.  Can these two bumbling heroes unravel this monstrous mystery or are they in for some very scary surprises?\n\nJohn Byer, Carol Kane, Jeffrey Jones and Norman Fell co-star in this hilarious horror spoof written and directed by Rudy DeLuca (co-writer of CAVEMAN and HIGH ANXIETY).\n\nFor laughs, screams and a good time call TRANSYLVANIA 6-5000!\n\n\n\nXvid avi\n\nSorry no subs available\n\n\n\nAs always, please do not hit and run!
