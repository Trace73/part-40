The series featured various women as they come and go, mirroring the continuous traffic of the ladies' room. \n\nThe Ladies was adapted from the all-female sketch show WC, which was performed at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe by Watson Howes' sketch troupe 'The Umbrella Girls'.\n\n\nCast:\nEmily Watson Howes\nKate Donmall\nFran Moulds\nSusanna Hislop\n\n\nThe Ladies - S01 - E01 \nThe Ladies - S01 - E02\nThe Ladies - S01 - E03\nThe Ladies - S01 - E04 \n\nThe Ladies - S01 - E01 \nThe Ladies - S01 - E02\nThe Ladies - S01 - E03\nThe Ladies - S01 - E04 \n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe3a5900148246cf1e7e0d0bf502ee8171c491c","amp;dn":"The+Ladies+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe3a5900148246cf1e7e0d0bf502ee8171c491c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,227,165,144,1,72,36,108,241,231,224,208,191,80,46,232,23,28,73,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
