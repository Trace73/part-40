Minnich\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nFor more than fifty years, the combined armed forces of the United States and the Republic of Korea have courageously shed sweat and blood in their tireless deterrence of the world's third largest army--the North Korean People's Army. Despite this half century stand-off, along the world's most militarized stretch of land known as the demilitarized zone, much remains unknown about this ruthless foe. James M. Minnich masterfully blends academic knowledge with nearly twenty-five years of military experience to explain the NKPA's origins, military ideology, strategy, combat formations, and tactics to ensure that no coalition combatant has to fight the NKPA without a full understanding of this ruthless, reclusive belligerent.\n\ntitle link:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa0ae467992a3a1298da30e790e9be263a2c8576","amp;dn":"The+North+Korean+People%27s+Army+Origins+and+Current+Tactics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa0ae467992a3a1298da30e790e9be263a2c8576","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,10,228,103,153,42,58,18,152,218,48,231,144,233,190,38,58,44,133,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
