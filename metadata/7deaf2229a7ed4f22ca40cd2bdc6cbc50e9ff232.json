The latter, though, isn't much of a redeeming feature - it's just something we're not used to with Wii versions of multiplatform games. But, credit where credit's due - the graphics are great. Pandora's jungle environment has been impressively brought to life on the power-starved Wii. It's lush, with ambient sound that does a convincing job of making the environment feel alive. The flying levels look particularly good, and the vistas are genuinely stunning for the Wii. It's just a shame that Avatar: The Game is better watched than played.\n\nIndeed it's a crying shame, because if you were able to map the various actions to button presses the entire game would be vastly improved (why can't I fly with the Nunchuck analogue stick?), while the stealth gameplay occasionally shows glimpses of what could have been. What has been, unfortunately, is yet another disappointing movie tie-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n____________________________________________\n\n|Works perfectly.                          |\n\n|Softmod + WiiFlow (USB Loader works too)  |\n____________________________________________\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS FROM GAME:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://worthplaying.com/article/2009/12/31/reviews/71254/images/250477/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://worthplaying.com/article/2009/12/31/reviews/71254/images/250477/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTorrent Downloaded from GamesTorrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7deaf2229a7ed4f22ca40cd2bdc6cbc50e9ff232","amp;dn":"James+Camerons+Avatar+The+Game+%5BMULTI6%5D%5BWII-Scrubber%5D%5BPAL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7deaf2229a7ed4f22ca40cd2bdc6cbc50e9ff232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,234,242,34,154,126,212,242,44,164,12,210,189,198,203,197,14,159,242,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
