But this time IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m actually going.\n\nMy nameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bobby Dollar, sometimes known as Doloriel, and of course, Hell isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a great place for someone like me - IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m an angel. They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t like my kind down there, not even the slightly fallen variety. But they have my girlfriend, who happens to be a beautiful demon named Casimira, Countess of Cold Hands. Why does an angel have a demon girlfriend? Well, certainly not because it helps my career.\n\nSheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being held hostage by one of the nastiest, most powerful demons in all of the netherworld - Eligor, Grand Duke of Hell. He already hates me, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like nothing better than to get his hands on me and rip my immortal soul right out of my borrowed but oh-so-mortal body.\n\nBut wait, it gets better! Not only do I have to sneak into Hell, make my way across thousands of miles of terror and suffering to reach Pandemonium, capital of the fiery depths, but then I have to steal Caz right out from under EligorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burning eyes and smuggle her out again, past demon soldiers, hellhounds, and all the murderous creatures imprisoned there for eternity. And even if I somehow manage to escape Hell, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m also being stalked by an undead psychopath named Smyler whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been following me for weeks. Oh, and did I mention that he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be killed?\n\nSo if I somehow survive Hell, elude the Grand Duke and all his hideous minions and make it back to the real world, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll still be the most hunted soul in Creation. But at least IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have Caz. Gotta have something to look forward to, right?\n\nSo just pour me that damn drink, will you? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got somewhere to go","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86e879d1ba04b87e3e09fdd5b3b5b2d8853b6c8a","amp;dn":"Tad+Williams+-+Happy+Hour+in+Hell+%28Bobby+Dollar+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86e879d1ba04b87e3e09fdd5b3b5b2d8853b6c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,232,121,209,186,4,184,126,62,9,253,213,179,181,178,216,133,59,108,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
