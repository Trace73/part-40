Known for their distinctive vocal harmony style (which influenced many other groups) they became one of the leading British bands of the era, and they enjoyed considerable popularity in many other countries (including Australia) although they did not achieve major US chart success until the early 1970s.\n\n Like The Rolling Stones and Steeleye Span, they are also notable as one of the few British pop bands of the Sixties that has never officially broken up and which continues to record and perform to the present.\n\n\n\n              ***He Ain't Heavy(He's My Brother).(1969)***\n\n\n      \n\n                               Enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0409d547b776138569ff5bf7fa3a398850af580c","amp;dn":"The+Hollies-He+Ain%5C%27t+Heavy%28He%5C%27s+My+Brother%29%28Footage%29-Wushan.VO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0409d547b776138569ff5bf7fa3a398850af580c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,9,213,71,183,118,19,133,105,255,91,247,250,58,57,136,80,175,88,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
