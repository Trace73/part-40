Rising to fame in the mid-'60s, Simon's songs were mature and literate, but also melodically engaging, and spoke to the concerns and uncertainties of a generation. As the 1960s gave way to the '70s and '80s, Simon's work tended to focus on the personal rather than the larger world, but he also expanded his musical palette, and helped introduce many rock and pop fans to world music. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFlac (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA &amp; 99.73% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tSony Music Japan\nCatalog:\t\tSICP 20340 &amp; SICP 20341\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.The Sound Of Silence (Live At Webster Hall, 2011)\n02.The Boxer (Live At Central Park, 1991)\n03.Bridge Over Troubled Water (Aretha Franklin)\n04.Mother And Child Reunion\n05.Tenderness\n06.Peace Like A River\n07.American Tune\n08.Kodachrome\n09.Something So Right\n10.Late In The Evening\n11.Train In The Distance\n12.Hearts And Bones\n13.Still Crazy After All These Years\n14.Rene And Georgette Magritte With Their Dog After The War\n15.Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\n16.The Boy In The Bubble\n17.Graceland\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.The Obvious Child\n02.Further To Fly\n03.The Cool, Cool River\n04.Spirit Voices\n05.Born In Puerto Rico\n06.Quality\n07.Darling Lorraine\n08.Look At That\n09.Senorita With A Necklace Of Tears\n10.That's Me\n11.Another Galaxy\n12.Father And Daughter\n13.Rewrite\n14.Love And Hard Times\n15.So Beautiful Or So What\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5db1dbe16203c1821efed589c57872cb42d5309c","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+-+Songwriter+%282011%29+FLAC+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5db1dbe16203c1821efed589c57872cb42d5309c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,177,219,225,98,3,193,130,30,254,213,137,197,120,114,203,66,213,48,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
