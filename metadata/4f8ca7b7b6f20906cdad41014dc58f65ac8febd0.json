The film begins with spring in North America and the migration to the Arctic; the flight is a community event for each species. Once in the Arctic, it&amp;#039;s family time: courtship, nests, eggs, fledglings, and first flight. Chicks must soon fly south. Bad weather, hunters, and pollution take their toll. Then, the cameras go south of the Equator; Antarctica is the summer destination. The search for food, good weather, and a place to hatch young takes this annual cycle of stamina across continents and oceans. There is a spare narration and a few titles; for the most part it&amp;#039;s visual, a bird&amp;#039;s eye view.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8ca7b7b6f20906cdad41014dc58f65ac8febd0","amp;dn":"Le_peuple_migrateur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8ca7b7b6f20906cdad41014dc58f65ac8febd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,140,167,183,182,242,9,6,205,173,65,1,77,197,143,101,172,143,235,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
