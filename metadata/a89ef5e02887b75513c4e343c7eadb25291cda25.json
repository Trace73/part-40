Key men Leigh Halfpenny, Scott Williams and Rhys Webb are all out of the tournament. It is another opportunity for fly half, Dan Biggar, to enhance his burgeoning reputation and skipper Sam Warburton leads from the front. Ireland will be keen to put their World Cup quarter-final exit at the hands of Argentina behind them, as they aim to claim the title for a third year in a row. Hooker Rory Best has big boots to fill - he replaces the talismanic Paul O'Connell as captain. Mark Pougatch presents live coverage from the Aviva stadium in Dublin, with analysis from former Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, former Wales captain Gareth Thomas, and Jonny Wilkinson, with pitch-side reports from Martin Bayfield and Maggie Alphonsi. Commentary comes from Nick Mullins, Gordon D'Arcy and Shane Williams.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 8984Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 50i/MBAFF\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384Kbps CBR 48KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 168 mins\r\nPart Size: 11.62 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89ef5e02887b75513c4e343c7eadb25291cda25","amp;dn":"Six.Nations.Rugby.2016.02.07.Ireland.v.Wales.1080i.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89ef5e02887b75513c4e343c7eadb25291cda25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,158,245,224,40,135,183,85,19,196,227,67,199,234,219,37,41,28,218,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
