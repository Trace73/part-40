Ti prende, ti centrifuga , ti sbatte a destra e manca e ti fa stare bene! Gianna &quot;energia pura&quot; Nannini in Giannissima, l' album dal vivio del '91che, quando lo metti sullo stereo e alzi il volume, scuote tutto e tutti!\n\nOne of the few female rockers left out there (my opinion), 33 years after her first record is still in a very good shape. She is selling out stadiums accross Europe. She takes you, centrifuges you, she hits you to left and right and she makes you feel good! Gianna &quot;pure energy&quot; Nannini in Giannissima, a '91 live recording, which, when you put it on the stereo and raise the volume is rocking everything and everyone!\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
