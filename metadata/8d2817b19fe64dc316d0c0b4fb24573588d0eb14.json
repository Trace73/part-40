You don't need to register or pay for 7-Zip. But you can make a donation to support further development of 7-Zip.\n\nThe main features of 7-Zip\n\nHigh compression ratio in new 7z format with LZMA compression\nSupported formats: \nPacking / unpacking: 7z, ZIP, GZIP, BZIP2 and TAR\nUnpacking only: ARJ, CAB, CHM, CPIO, DEB, DMG, HFS, ISO, LZH, LZMA, MSI, NSIS, RAR, RPM, UDF, WIM, XAR and Z.\nFor ZIP and GZIP formats, 7-Zip provides a compression ratio that is 2-10 % better than the ratio provided by PKZip and WinZip\nStrong AES-256 encryption in 7z and ZIP formats\nSelf-extracting capability for 7z format\nIntegration with Windows Shell\nPowerful File Manager\nPowerful command line version\nPlugin for FAR Manager\nLocalizations for 74 languages\n \n\n7-Zip works in Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP/Vista.
