A financial world operates in the shadows surrounded by a high level of secrecy. A place where sizeable capital streams travel the world at the speed of light and avoid paying tax. The Tax Free Tour is an economic thriller mapping the systemic risk for governments and citizens alike. Is this the price we have to pay for globalised capitalism?\n\nAt the same time, the free online game &quot;Taxodus&quot; by Femke Herregraven is launched. In the game, the player can select the profile of a multinational and look for the global route to pay as little tax as possible.\n\nResearch: William de Bruijn\nCamera: Jean Counet\nMontage: Bart van den Broek\nGeluid: Tim van Peppen, Benny Jansen, Joris van Ballegoijen\nProductie: Marie Schutgens\nAnimaties: Bitcaves &amp; Motoko","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01264c9330a179261c534e4d993c63939038703a","amp;dn":"The+Tax+Free+Tour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01264c9330a179261c534e4d993c63939038703a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,38,76,147,48,161,121,38,28,83,78,77,153,60,99,147,144,56,112,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
