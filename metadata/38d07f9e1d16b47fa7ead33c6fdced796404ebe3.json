Good As New (3:37)\n\nGary Allan subscribes to Gene Watson's school of country music, agreeing with the legend that people really do want to hear a sad song.\n\n&quot;Nobody cares if I'm happy, why would you want to write about that?&quot; muses the singer-songwriter. &quot;I don't want to hear songs about how sunshiny things are. I like the songs that are cutting edge and real heart-wrenchers.&quot;\n\nSo why then, is Gary's fastest-rising single, &quot;Every Storm (Runs Out of Rain),&quot; a song filled with hope? Well, it was actually born of a not-so-sunshiny situation.\n\n&quot;I wrote the song with Hillary Lindsey and Matt Warren, and Matt was kind of going through a hard time,&quot; Gary tells The Boot. &quot;He was going through a dry spell, like all writers do, and he hadn't been writing many songs. He was doing yard work one day, weed eating, and he hit a rock and it hit the house and then bounced back and hit him in the forehead. He was pissed, and he called me and talked to me about it ... He had the line, 'Every storm runs out of rain.'&quot;\n\nThe song was released as the first single from Gary's new album, Set You Free, and became his fastest-rising single to date. So, his record label decided it would be best to move the album's release from March to today (Jan. 22).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38d07f9e1d16b47fa7ead33c6fdced796404ebe3","amp;dn":"Gary+Allan+-+Set+You+Free+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38d07f9e1d16b47fa7ead33c6fdced796404ebe3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,208,127,158,29,22,180,127,167,234,211,60,111,220,237,121,100,4,235,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
