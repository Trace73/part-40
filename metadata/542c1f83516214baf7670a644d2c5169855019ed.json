During each episode, the unsuspecting &quot;marks&quot; will think they are the stars of a new game show or reality show, or that they are auditioning for a big Hollywood movie or television role. What they don't realize is, they ARE the stars, but in the most unexpected and entertaining way, in front of millions of people on TV. Sometimes as himself, other times incognito, Howie and his crew, including his very own son Alex, and &quot;man on the street&quot; Vic will venture anywhere -- from the great outdoors, to a night club, or to the set of a talk show -- to play out a hoax the likes of which viewers have never seen before. These are 15-minutes of fame some people can do without, and with Howie in disguise, you never know what will happen next!\n\n\n\nthe quality was a little variable from flv to flv, theres some small glitches between commercial breaks\nand the audio was butchered more than once, Ive almost got a system down for hulu rips though, next one should\nbe much better.\n\n\nName: howie-do-it-episode-2.avi\n\nLength: 22:02.720\nFramerate: 25.000 fps\nResolution: 480x368 (1.304)\nVideocodec: XviD ISO MPEG-4 (MPEG-4  B-VOP   )\nVideobitrate: 846 kbps\nAudio: MP3, 2 chnl(s), 192 kbps CBR, 44100 Hz\n \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/janmlaabd.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/janmlaabd.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:542c1f83516214baf7670a644d2c5169855019ed","amp;dn":"Howie+Do+It+S01E02+hulu_rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"542c1f83516214baf7670a644d2c5169855019ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,44,31,131,81,98,20,186,247,103,10,100,77,44,81,105,133,80,25,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
