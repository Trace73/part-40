Tsou (AP, 1989).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 0-12-701905-7\r\n\r\nCurrent Biochemical Research in China presents the Chinese contributions to the biochemical sciences. This book aims to make the situation of biochemical research in China better known to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nOrganized into 21 chapters, this book begins with an overview of some of the fundamental research of Chinese biochemists, which may be found interesting by colleagues in the western world. This text then presents the investigations of the relationship between structure and function of proteins by synthetic methods. Other chapters provide the comprehensive and scientific compilation of the herb medicines used in China since ancient times. This book discusses as well the correlation of molecular structures of proteins with their biological functions. The final chapter deals with the importance of hemostasis and thrombosis wherein platelets adhere to injured vascular wall and aggregate to form the white hemostatic plug.\r\n\r\nThis book is a valuable resource for biochemists, biophysicists, scientists, and research workers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08117a809fd014774f5bdfb4171a0ea22c655a1","amp;dn":"Current+Biochemical+Research+in+China+-+C.L.+Tsou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08117a809fd014774f5bdfb4171a0ea22c655a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,129,23,168,9,253,1,71,116,245,189,251,65,113,160,234,34,198,85,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
