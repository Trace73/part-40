The aim of this book is to systematically summarize and record the recent notable advances in various topics of organic crystal chemistry involving liquid crystals and organicâ€“inorganic hybrid materials that have been achieved mainly in the last 5 years or so. The authors are invited members of the Division of Organic Crystals, The Chemical Society of Japan (CSJ), and prominent invited experts from abroad. This edited volume is planned to be published periodically, at least every 5 years, with contributions by prominent authors in Japan and from abroad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f58eb61327506de96bee9ddbab912ccfffc7ea30","amp;dn":"Advances+in+Organic+Crystal+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f58eb61327506de96bee9ddbab912ccfffc7ea30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,142,182,19,39,80,109,233,107,238,157,219,171,145,44,207,255,199,234,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
