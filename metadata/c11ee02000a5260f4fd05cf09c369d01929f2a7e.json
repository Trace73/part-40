While it's unusual to release a live album so soon after a group's debut, it was a wise decision. \n\nAs good as Three Dog Night's singles were - and they were some of the finest AM radio staples of the era - they only hint at how powerful the group were live. While leader Danny Hutton was a protege of Brian Wilson, lead singer Chuck Negron came from an R&amp;B tradition, and that collision of pristine pop and gutbucket soul was the tension which drove the group. \n\nOn CAPTURED LIVE AT THE FORUM, Negron is clearly in charge, with a rocking cover of the Band's &quot;Chest Fever,&quot; and a version of the chestnut &quot;Try a Little Tenderness&quot; styled after Otis Redding's definitive reading, nearly outshining the often-excellent renditions of Three Dog Night hits like Harry Nilsson's &quot;One&quot; and Laura Nyro's &quot;Eli's ComingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c11ee02000a5260f4fd05cf09c369d01929f2a7e","amp;dn":"Three+Dog+Night+-+Captured+Live+At+The+Forum+1969+%2F+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c11ee02000a5260f4fd05cf09c369d01929f2a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,30,224,32,0,165,38,15,79,208,92,240,156,54,157,1,146,159,42,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
