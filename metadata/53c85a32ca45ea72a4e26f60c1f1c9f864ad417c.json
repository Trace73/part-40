The first two tracks are Lewis compositions, still the classic MJQ cool jazz but with a bit of an atmospheric vibe.\n\nThe Modern Jazz Quartet took a hiatus from Atlantic Records to record two LPs for The Beatles' Apple label. Despite the switch, The MJQ's music remained unchanged; it was too classic to alter. This out-of-print album has among its selections a pair of obscure John Lewis originals (&quot;Visitor from Venus&quot; and &quot;Visitor from Mars&quot;), vibraphonist Milt Jackson's ballad feature on &quot;Here's That Rainy Day&quot; and the lengthy &quot;Adagio from Concierto De Aranjuez.&quot; Overall this is an average but worthy outing from a group whose excellence could always be taken for granted. ~ Scott Yanow - AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nPercy Heath - Bass\nMilt Jackson - Vibraphone\nConnie Kay - Drums\nJohn Lewis - Piano\n\nModern Jazz Quartet - Space Tracks:\n01  Visitor from Venus - 5:40\n02  Visitor from Mars - 7:18\n03  HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That Rainy Day - 4:20\n04  Dilemma - 5:48\n05  Adagio from Concierto de Aranjuez - 10:18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c85a32ca45ea72a4e26f60c1f1c9f864ad417c","amp;dn":"Modern+Jazz+Quartet+-+Space+%281969%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c85a32ca45ea72a4e26f60c1f1c9f864ad417c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,200,90,50,202,69,234,114,164,226,111,96,193,241,201,248,100,173,65,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
