Some tunnels that are still visible 1500 feet up mountainsides are thought to have been established 400 years ago, when the valleys would have been studded with workshops, scaffolding and water-powered machines, and home to a brave band of Tudor miners. \n\nBut few signs remain of their presence, and nobody really knows what this place looked like back then. Archaeologists hardly know anything about Elizabethan mines. \n\nThe Team battle the rain, the wind and dangerously unstable trackways. But the combination of sheer effort and some ultra-high-tech kit finally takes them into the heart of the old mine-works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:423ee469b51df6d026f40015d25faa9ac51fe9fc","amp;dn":"Time+Team+S20xE06%28OverloadExtreme.net%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"423ee469b51df6d026f40015d25faa9ac51fe9fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,62,228,105,181,29,246,208,38,244,0,21,210,95,170,154,197,31,233,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
