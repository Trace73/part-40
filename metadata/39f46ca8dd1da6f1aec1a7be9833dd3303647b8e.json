That's what Elvis Presley said, and he should know. To mark the 20th anniversary of Orbison's death, this programme celebrates the extraordinary talent of 'The Big O' and his relationship with his most loyal and enduring fans, British musicians and the British public. Through a combination of interview and archive, it charts Orbison's career in Britain, from the sell-out tour with the Beatles that sky-rocketed him to international superstardom, right up to the collaboration with lifelong friend George Harrison on the Travelling Wilburys project in the late 1980s.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f46ca8dd1da6f1aec1a7be9833dd3303647b8e","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+-+The+Big+O+in+Britain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f46ca8dd1da6f1aec1a7be9833dd3303647b8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,244,108,168,221,29,166,241,174,193,167,190,152,51,221,51,3,100,123,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
