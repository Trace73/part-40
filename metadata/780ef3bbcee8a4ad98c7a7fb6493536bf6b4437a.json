Babar is a young elephant who undergoes many challenges and adventures. But Babar always finds the strength to rise above difficulty and search out every cloud's silver lining. Babar is crowned king of the elephants, plans and builds Celesteville, and becomes a father himself. And he learns the greatest lesson of all: despite life's challenges, great things are possible if one never gets discouraged.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:780ef3bbcee8a4ad98c7a7fb6493536bf6b4437a","amp;dn":"Babar+s01ep01+Babar%5C%27s+1st+Step","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"780ef3bbcee8a4ad98c7a7fb6493536bf6b4437a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,14,243,187,206,232,164,173,152,199,167,251,100,147,83,107,246,180,67,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
