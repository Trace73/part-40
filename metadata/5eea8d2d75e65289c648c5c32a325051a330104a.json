Teamed with the exemplary guitarist Scrapper Blackwell in Indianapolis, Carr became one of the top blues stars of his day, composing and recording almost 200 sides during his short lifetime, including such classics as &quot;How Long, How Long,&quot; &quot;Prison Bound Blues,&quot; &quot;When the Sun Goes Down,&quot; and &quot;Blues Before Sunrise.&quot; His blues were expressive and evocative, recorded only with piano and guitar, yet as author Sam Charters has noted, Carr was &quot;a city man&quot; whose singing was never as rough or intense as that of the country bluesmen, and as reissue producer Francis Smith put it, &quot;He, perhaps more than any other single artist, was responsible for transforming the rural blues patterns of the '20s into the more city-oriented blues of the '30s.&quot; \n\nBorn: Mar 27, 1905 in Nashville, TN\n\nDied: Apr 29, 1935 in Indianapolis, IN\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tBlues\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Midnight Hour Blues\n02.Mean Mistreater Mama\n03.Hurry Down Sunshine\n04.Corn Likker Blues\n05.Shady Lane Blues\n06.Blues Before Sunrise\n07.Take A Walk Around The Corner\n08.My Woman's Gone Wrong\n09.Southbound Blues\n10.Barrelhouse Women\n11.I Believe I'll Make A Change\n12.Bobo Stomp\n13.Big Four Blues\n14.Hustler's Blues\n15.Shining Pistol\n16.It's Too Short\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eea8d2d75e65289c648c5c32a325051a330104a","amp;dn":"Leroy+Carr+-+Blues+Before+Sunrise+%281989%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eea8d2d75e65289c648c5c32a325051a330104a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,234,141,45,117,230,82,137,198,72,197,195,42,50,80,81,163,48,16,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
