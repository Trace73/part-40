He hasn't achieved the level of interest today that Domenico Scarlatti has, in good part because Scarlatti's music was preserved both in publications and in fair copies in the Spanish royal library, while Seixas' music was nearly all lost in a huge earthquake and fire that consumed one of the finest musical libraries in Europe. Enough remains to establish both his individuality and talent.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
