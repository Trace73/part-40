Arranged marriages can be used as a strategic way of influencing other realms. It is possible to effect greater change with a single marriage than would be possible with an army of your strongest warriors.\r\n\r\nThe world is a dangerous place. Nature may be your greatest adversary. When the heavens erupt with thunder and lightning, you must take steps to ensure your crops arenâ€™t forfeit. Cut down and burn the surrounding woodland to keep the population warm and their meals hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the population grows, it will be imperative to expand their knowledge. Only by being at the forefront of new sciences and technologies, will you be able to defend yourself against greater enemies. Increased knowledge provides the benefit of increasing production efficiency. However, knowledge and skepticism can lead to questions, and questions can lead to rebellion!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41f0d2d12fee1256c76290a20682690571eb2075","amp;dn":"Feudalism+v1.0.7b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41f0d2d12fee1256c76290a20682690571eb2075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,240,210,209,47,238,18,86,199,98,144,162,6,130,105,5,113,235,32,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
