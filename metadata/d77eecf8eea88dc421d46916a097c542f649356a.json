Six months later, a recording of\nBaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rant on the set of Terminator Salvation was\nleaked, and the starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s anger began to define him.\n\nBut beyond his notorious temper, Bale, an Academy\nAward-winning actor for his role in The Fighter, is\nknown for his ability to physically transform himself\nfor roles in American Psycho, The Machinist, and as\none of HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most revered and bankable\ncharactersÃ¢â‚¬â€Batman.\n\nIn Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest\nBatman, Best Biography winner in the 2013 Indie\nExcellence Awards and finalist in the 2013 Indie\nBook Awards, BaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former publicist and assistant\nHarrison CheungÃ¢â‚¬â€his real-life AlfredÃ¢â‚¬â€shares an\ninside look into the little-known personal life of the\nintensely private and reclusive actor. In the first\nbiography of the Batman star, Cheung, who lived\nand worked with Christian and his father for 10\nyears, shares firsthand accounts of the BalesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\nfamilial dysfunction, ChristianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s morbid\nfascinations and dark humor, and his extreme\ndedication to his craft.\n\nAware that Bale hated his traditional publicity duties,\nCheung launched an extensive Internet marketing\ncampaign for the actor, built the first official actor\nwebsite for him, and cultivated the Baleheads, an\nonline fan community that was used to garner\neditorial coverage and ultimately help Bale secure\nthe role of the Caped Crusader.\n\nWritten with veteran Hollywood and entertainment\nreporter Nicola Pittam, Christian Bale: The Inside Story\nof the Darkest Batman uncovers BaleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transformation\nfrom shy, English child actor to Internet sensation to\nHollywood bad boy.\n\n\nChristian Bale The Inside\nStory of the Darkest Batman\nBy Harrison Cheung\nLanguage:EN\nPages: EPUB 509","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d77eecf8eea88dc421d46916a097c542f649356a","amp;dn":"Christian+Bale+The+Inside+Story+of+the+Darkest+Batman+by+Harriso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d77eecf8eea88dc421d46916a097c542f649356a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,126,236,248,238,168,141,196,33,212,105,22,160,151,197,66,246,73,53,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
