The authors identify and illuminate selected transcription factor oncoproteins and tumor suppressors, together with nuclear proteins that are central to the phenotype of the tumor cell involved in chromatin control. The emphasis is on new targets and approaches to cancer treatment derived from the cancer cell cycle, gene control targets, and angiogenesis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:099effef634d0d0a0d312c54ebb7bb8f4edb5824","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2002%5D+Targets+for+Cancer+Chemotherapy+%28Cancer+Drug+Discov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"099effef634d0d0a0d312c54ebb7bb8f4edb5824","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,158,255,239,99,77,13,10,13,49,44,84,235,183,187,143,78,219,88,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
