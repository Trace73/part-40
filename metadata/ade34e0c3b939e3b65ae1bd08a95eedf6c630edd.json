Up until this point, he was the only member of Metallica to perform at every show. While other members (Kirk, Rob, Jason, Cliff, Dave and Ron) never missed any shows, each was, of course, never always in Metallica. James missed three shows in July 2000.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ade34e0c3b939e3b65ae1bd08a95eedf6c630edd","amp;dn":"Metallica+-+Donington+England+6-6-2004+SOUNDBOARD+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ade34e0c3b939e3b65ae1bd08a95eedf6c630edd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,227,78,12,59,147,158,59,101,174,27,208,138,149,238,223,108,99,14,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
