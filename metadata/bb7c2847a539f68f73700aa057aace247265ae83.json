They were introduced, in 2007, by their mutual friend, Francesco Donadello, during what would become SparklehorseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final European tour. Backstage, they developed an instant rapport and subsequently, across the Continent (Belgium, Germany, Italy), formed a collaborative friendship. In the meantime, both artists continued working on other projects: alone, 2011 has delivered both OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢HalloranÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LumiÃƒÂ¨re and sleepingdogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s With Our Head in the Clouds and Our Hearts in the Field, the second collaborative effort between Chantal Acda and Wiltzie. However, A Winged Victory for the Sullen fell into a singular focus, rising from long conversations, a series of sketches, and shared visions, and conformed to the weight of death and two dissolving marriages. (Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a heavy time for us both.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) Additionally, they invited the prolific multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick and the Icelandic cellist Hildur GuÃƒÂ°nadÃƒÂ³ttir to perform on the album. Together, they created A Winged Victory for the Sullen. Ã¢â‚¬Å“[We] wanted to name it something with sort of a grand feeling.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They patched together, in part, a name from the ruined remains of an antiquated victory and claimed it as their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb7c2847a539f68f73700aa057aace247265ae83","amp;dn":"A+Winged+Victory+for+the+Sullen+%5B2011%5D+%28320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb7c2847a539f68f73700aa057aace247265ae83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,124,40,71,165,57,246,143,115,112,10,160,87,170,206,36,114,101,174,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
