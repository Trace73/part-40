It tells of the romance between a beauteous daughter of the aristocracy and a lowly-born soldier who has deserted after fighting honorably through the shattering battle of Flanders and the tragic evacuation of Dunkirk.\n\nAlthough the screen adaptation softens certain aspects of Eric M. KnightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel, such as toning down the love affair during the coupleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stay at the Dover inn, or eliminating the complication of the soldierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brain injury, it has not weakened the story.\n\nIn some ways the yarn is even improved. For one thing, the whole involved subject of the democratic aims in the war, problem of the conflict of social classes, or the question of pacifism against duty to oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s country are expertly focused in personal terms. \n\nHollywood does its bit for the war effort in this stirring romance starring Tyrone Power and Joan Fontaine: he's a war hero turned deserter, she's the WAAF who convinces him that he needs to carrying on fighting the good fight in the name of democracy.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 910mb\nDuration.... 01:46:00\nCodec.... avc1\nFrame Width.... 640\nFrame Height.... 464\nData Rate.... 1089kbps\nFrame Rate.... 25F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 106kbps\n2 Channel Stereo\nAudio Sample Rate.... 44KHz\nBits Per Sample 16 Bit/Sample","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454adfb180f85d614d922e718b68fea80536ef20","amp;dn":"This+Above+All+1942+DvdRip+Mp4+Lee1001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454adfb180f85d614d922e718b68fea80536ef20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,74,223,177,128,248,93,97,77,146,46,113,139,104,254,168,5,54,239,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
