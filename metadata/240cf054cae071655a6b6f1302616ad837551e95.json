Examining the great forces that shape the Earth - volcanoes, the ocean, the atmosphere and ice - the programme explores their central roles in our planet&amp;#039;s story. How do these forces affect the Earth&amp;#039;s landscape, its climate, and its history? CGI gives the audience a ringside seat at these great events, while the final episode brings together all the themes of the series and argues that Earth is an exceptionally rare kind of planet - giving us a special responsibility to look after our unique world. This is a series that shows the Earth in new and surprising ways. Extensive use of satellite imagery reveals new views of our planet, while timelapse filmed over many months brings the planet to life. Offering a balance between dramatic visuals and illuminating facts, this ground-breaking series makes global science truly compelling.\n\nRelated Documentaries\nVolcano\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\nTotal Size (MB) ....: ~745.00 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: ~00:59:00\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: ~1560 KB/s\nResolution .........: 720 x 400\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.80:1\nQuality Factor .....: 0.217 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forums&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forums&lt;/a&gt; mvgroup org\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Earth_-_The_Power_of_the_Planet&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Earth_-_The_Power_of_the_Planet&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:240cf054cae071655a6b6f1302616ad837551e95","amp;dn":"BBC+Earth+The+Power+Of+The+P.l.anet.5of5.Rare.Earth.XviD.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"240cf054cae071655a6b6f1302616ad837551e95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,12,240,84,202,224,113,101,90,107,111,19,2,97,106,216,55,85,30,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
