Panorama goes undercover to see this subtle persuasion at work and asks whether you should have the right to know who is paying your doctor.\n\nAnd as Britain's most profitable drug company, GlaxoSmithKline, waits to hear whether it will face criminal charges following allegations of bribery in China, the programme reveals new evidence that GSK was recently paying doctors to boost prescriptions much closer to home, in Europe.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be61f027e41ed94af2b2b5a147fea17864b1af39","amp;dn":"Panorama_-_Whos_Paying_Your_Doctor.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be61f027e41ed94af2b2b5a147fea17864b1af39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,97,240,39,228,30,217,74,242,178,181,161,71,254,161,120,100,177,175,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
