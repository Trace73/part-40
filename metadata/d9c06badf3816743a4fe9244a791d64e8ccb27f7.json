Now he is retiring and takes part in the end-of-year entertainment for the last time. Entitled Speak For England, Arthur, it weaves together a multi-genrational story of England: the glorious era at the turn of the century, when summers were always golden; the fast-living inter-war years peopled by the Bloomsbury Group; and the growing cynicism of a country facing a second world war with the scars of the first still fresh in their memories.\n\nToungue-in-cheek, the play-within-a-play prompts an outraged response from the Headmaster, who can only see his beloved standards being mocked. Yet, within the parody lies an almost painful nostalgia for a more peaceful age and the timeless misunderstanding of one generation by another.\n\nClever, funny and poignant, Alan Bennett&amp;#039;s masterful play is rightly regarded as a modern classic.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c06badf3816743a4fe9244a791d64e8ccb27f7","amp;dn":"Alan+Bennett+-+Forty+Yeras+On+-+BBC+Radio+4+Full-Cast+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c06badf3816743a4fe9244a791d64e8ccb27f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,192,107,173,243,129,103,67,164,254,146,68,167,145,214,78,140,203,39,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
