Lovers Rock allowed young people to experience intimacy and healing through dance- known as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“scrubbingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢- at parties and clubs. This dance provided a coping mechanism for what was happening on the streets. Lovers Rock developed into a successful sound with national UK hits and was influential to British bands (Police, Culture Club, UB40) These influences underline the impact the music was making in bridging the multi-cultural gap that polarized the times. The film sheds light on a forgotten period of British music, social and political history.\n\nGenre: Documentary\nStarring: Dennis Bovell, Paulette Harris-German, Janet Kay\nDirector: Menelik Shabazz\nRun Time: 1h 38mn\nResolution: 560 pixels x 304 pixels\nOverall Bitrate: 996 Kbps\nVideo format: AVI @ 846 Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio 48.0 KHz\nDownload size: 730.26MB\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/hIDA2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/hIDA2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/UvXgP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgcrave.com/u/UvXgP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a25bd23b1079bfceef0a8bcbed5170383dc6175","amp;dn":"The+Story+Of+Lovers+Rock+2011+DVDRip+XviD+SPRiNTER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a25bd23b1079bfceef0a8bcbed5170383dc6175","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,37,189,35,177,7,155,252,238,240,168,188,190,213,23,3,131,220,97,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
