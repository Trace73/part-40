Burn in Hades is a story that, like RowlingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, contains layers upon layers of meaning all wrapped within an entertaining story and sandwiched between intriguing characters.\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Susan P. Sipal, Harry Potter for Writers\n\n\\&quot;It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t often that I read a book the first time and fall in love with it immediately. I think the last time that happened was with the Harry Potter series.\\&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jane Woolsey\n\n\n\nBook Description\n\nCross never forgives because he never forgets.\n\nHaunted by the Hell of his past transgressions, he sets out on an epic journey across the underworld to paradiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½not to frolic in the gardens with the righteous, but to drink from the river Lethe which causes complete forgetfulness.\n\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a rare soul who remembers his life before death, known throughout the underworld as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Man Who RemembersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a bounty on his memories, and envious spirits hunt his head to steal them.\n\nErasing his mind will get the spirits off his neck and allow him to keep his crown on its throne, but he will have to continue his afterlife in an ignorant bliss. Even more unfortunate for him, paradise is guarded by a great wall that annihilates any soul that gets too close. No member of the damned has ever broken in.\n\nBURN IN HADES is an action packed and fast-paced fantasy by Michael L. Martin Jr. It is the first book in The Life After Death Trilogy and is approximately 113,000 words long (about 400 printed pages).\n\nMartin has built a world so rich and complex, fans are eagerly picking apart every word and hunting for clues! BURN IN HADES bridges mythology from over fourteen different cultures with MartinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original concepts and will engage both loyal and casual fantasy readers.\n\nTaking inspiration from Sergio LeoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s epic spaghetti western, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Martin weaves a sweeping tale of battles, betrayals, and unlikely bonds. The plot revolves around three main characters: a human soul who goes by the name Cross; a fallen angel called The Raven, who follows her own law; and a demon named Diamond Tooth, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s simply terrifying.\n\n\n\nIf you enjoy the authors work, here\\'s how you can help:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢     Write an honest review for the novel on your blog/Amazon/Barnes &amp; Noble/etc.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢     Recommend the novel to others.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢     Consider purchasing an official copy of the novel for yourself or for someone else:\n\nAmazon US: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006EO5DXA\nAmazon UK: https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B006EO5DXA\nAmazon DE: https://www.amazon.de/dp/B006EO5DXA\nAmazon FR: https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B006EO5DXA\nAmazon IT: https://www.amazon.it/dp/B006EO5DXA\nAmazon ES: https://www.amazon.es/dp/B006EO5DXA\nBarnes &amp; Noble: http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/books/1107757152\nGoodreads: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13122377-burn-in-hades\niBooks: http://itunes.apple.com/us/book/burn-in-hades/id487252844\n\n\nThe Official Website of Michael L.
