King (born September 16, 1925), known by the stage name B.B. King, is an American blues musician, singer, songwriter, and guitarist.\n\nRolling Stone magazine ranked him at No. 6 on its 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time (previously ranked No. 3 in the 2003 edition of the same list), and he was ranked No. 17 in Gibson's &quot;Top 50 Guitarists of All Time&quot;. According to Edward M. Komara, King &quot;introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending and shimmering vibrato that would influence virtually every electric blues guitarist that followed.&quot; King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He is considered one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname &quot;The King of Blues&quot;, and one of the &quot;Three Kings of the Blues Guitar&quot; (along with Albert King and Freddie King). King is also known for performing tirelessly throughout his musical career appearing at 250-300 concerts per year until his seventies. In 1956 it was noted that he appeared at 342 shows. King continues to appear at 100 shows a year.\n\nOver the years, King has developed one of the world's most identifiable guitar styles. He borrowed from Blind Lemon Jefferson, T-Bone Walker and others, integrating his precise and complex vocal-like string bends and his left hand vibrato, both of which have become indispensable components of rock guitarists' vocabulary. His economy and phrasing has been a model for thousands of players. King has mixed blues, jazz, swing, mainstream pop and jump into a unique sound. In King's words, &quot;When I sing, I play in my mind; the minute I stop singing orally, I start to sing by playing Lucille.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcf40afdd1232bd03d4e7ab773f53f38020f3584","amp;dn":"B.B.+King+13+Vinyls%2B1+Cass%2B2+SACD%27s+%281956-2003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcf40afdd1232bd03d4e7ab773f53f38020f3584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,244,10,253,209,35,43,208,61,78,122,183,115,245,63,56,2,15,53,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
