The comics feature Cade Skywalker, a descendant of Luke Skywalker, who was trained as a Jedi but has abandoned the order. He apprenticed himself to the pirate Rav and lives among bounty hunters, smugglers and pirates. Cade has also dropped his last name.\n\nThis series is excellent for Star Wars fans.  Its one of the best comics in the franchise.  The plot is rich, the characters are well played, and the art lush.  Dont miss this.  Ill SEED as much as my internet connection allows, and after that I hope others help too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db87695a9444ec5717edffab5b12e6cc3ee9b0f","amp;dn":"Star+Wars%3A+Legacy+Vol.+0.5-28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db87695a9444ec5717edffab5b12e6cc3ee9b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,184,118,149,169,68,78,197,113,126,223,250,181,177,46,108,195,238,155,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
