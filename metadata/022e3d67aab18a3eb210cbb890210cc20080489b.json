One is fighting to save his father's life and using the money to pay off gambling debts accumulated by his father. The second is fighting for the money to get out of the ghetto. While being exploited by a boxing promoter, the two teens become friends. An explosive ending puts the two friends in the ring against each other in a fight for survival.\n\nThis film didn't win any Oscars and it's not a dramatic masterpiece but it's never boring and moves along nicely. The fight scenes are entertaining, the chemistry between Marshall and Cuba is good, and the majority of the characters are well acted and well developed.  The movie has a good soundtrack and a noticeable visual style that stays constant throughout the film.  Bottomline: an entertaining kick-ass action movie.\nDirected by Rowdy Herrington\nProduced by Frank Price and Stephen J.
