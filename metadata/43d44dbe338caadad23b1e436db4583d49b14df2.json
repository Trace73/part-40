Clifton, NJ primarily instrumental trio Undercover Rabbis have got you covered with their latest effort Empires, which could easily serve as the soundtrack to the coming of The Four Horsemen.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nMike Mehalick - Speak Into My Good Eye\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the kind of thing youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find yourself coming back to over and over and appreciating more each time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nGary Hill - MusicEmissions.com\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Undercover Rabbis are one of those bands that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fit into a specific genre, instead opting to go down their own route and leave everyone guessing as to how theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to follow it. The album on offer here isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one which follows any convention or copies any band, instead presenting a sound which will confound, surprise, and leave you wondering whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming next. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be interested in keeping an eye on these guys to see what comes next, I think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to be an interesting ride!
