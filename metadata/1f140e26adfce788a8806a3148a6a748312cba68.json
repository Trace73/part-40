Each take, consisting of carfully generated patches on the serge.\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by GÃƒÂ¶ran SandstrÃƒÂ¶m and Didrik Madheden\n\n2) Veqtor &amp; 2tronik01 - Azimuth Wrap Zenith\n===========================================\nBy recording and a low frequency pulse oscillator, and modifiying its frequency with multiple modulation source, an seemingly random syncronization pulse was created, this pulse was then used to drive sequencers and envelopes in a humoungus serge-patch.\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by GÃƒÂ¶ran SandstrÃƒÂ¶m and Didrik Madheden\n\n3) Veqtor &amp; 2tronik01 - nLog43168\n=================================\nAgain, using a seemingly random pulse as the base clock, a slope generator was used to create longer notes, which control the frequency of a filter, through which the spring tank reverb is in a feedback loop, creating the eerie notes in this recording. Of course there&amp;#039;s a lot of modulations going on.\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by GÃƒÂ¶ran SandstrÃƒÂ¶m and Didrik Madheden\n\n4) Veqtor - Parasiticurrent Modulations\n=======================================\nThe most unconventional track, a custom reaktor ensemble was used used to send out pulses into the buchla&amp;#039;s source of uncertainty module, this was used to control several oscillators, which were routed through two modules of timbral gates, one then being run through the reverb. Then they frequency shifting each other (each channel routed to one frequency shifter, being shifted by the other, then mixed), but not quite, since the internal oscillator is set to on, but the other channel does make a differency, perhaps it is amplitude modulating the internal oscillator, it was difficult to tell, after about half the song, the internal oscillator is switched off, in favor of the pure channel.\n\nWritten &amp; Performed by GÃƒÂ¶ran SandstrÃƒÂ¶m\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f140e26adfce788a8806a3148a6a748312cba68","amp;dn":"Veqtor+%26+2tronik01+-+Analogik2+%5BOXOMP3002%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f140e26adfce788a8806a3148a6a748312cba68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,20,14,38,173,252,231,136,168,128,106,49,72,166,167,72,49,44,186,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
