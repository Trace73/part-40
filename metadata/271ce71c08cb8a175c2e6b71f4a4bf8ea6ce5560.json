While working there she discovered a long term strategic plan by the tax exempt foundations to transform America from a nation of rugged individualists and problem solvers to a country of servile, brainwashed minions who simply regurgitate whatever they're told. \n\nPart one of our exclusive interview with Iserbyt breaks down how conditioning/training under a corporate agenda has replaced traditional education, leading to a deliberate dumbing down of Americans. Iserbyt further explains how Reagan signed agreements merging the U.S. and Soviet systems under the United Nations banner, turning over education and many other areas of public policy to global control.\n\nThis 74 minute exposÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is a must see for anyone who wants to truly know why the education system is deliberately crafted to produce human drones with no critical thinking whose only skills are to be subservient, trust authority and follow orders.\n\nWatch out for part two, in which Iserbyt will unveil the connection of her father and grandfather to the elite Skull &amp; Bones secret society, including an exclusive look at the official members list the public was never meant to see. Iserbyt also explores the research of Anthony Sutton and others whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve made the connection between Skull &amp; Bones, the Illuminati and experimental psychology from Germany that has been injected into the American education system since the late 1800s. Also in play is the eliteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s control of the Left-Right political paradigm, infiltration of key policy groups and backing from globalist foundations that have threatened to undermine the American way for the better part of a century.\n\nVisit Iserbyt's website at http://www.deliberatedumbingdown.com/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:271ce71c08cb8a175c2e6b71f4a4bf8ea6ce5560","amp;dn":"The+Miseducation+of+America+by+Charlotte+Iserbyt+pt+1+MP4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"271ce71c08cb8a175c2e6b71f4a4bf8ea6ce5560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,28,231,28,8,203,138,23,92,46,107,113,244,164,191,142,166,206,85,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
