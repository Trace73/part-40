It may not be punk -- then again, it may be his concept of punk -- but Glass Houses is the closest Joel ever got to a pure rock album.\n- Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\t\n\n\nGlass Houses is the seventh album by American singer-songwriter Billy Joel, released in 1980. It features Joels first song to peak at #1 on Billboards Pop Singles chart, It's Still Rock and Roll to Me. The album itself topped the Pop Albums chart for six weeks and was ranked number 4 on Billboards 1980 year-end album chart.\n\nOpening with the sound of glass shattering, Glass Houses has more of a hard rock feel than Joels prior albums. Accordingly, the response to this album was quite mixed. Glass Houses alienated many long-time fans, while at the same time, attracted many new fans to his music.\n\nThe album cover consists of Joel poised to throw a rock through the big two story window of his real life modern waterfront glass house in Oyster Bay. He moved into it in 1977, after being turned down for an apartment at The Dakota. On the back of the cover, Joel is shown looking through a jagged hole he supposedly made with the rock he threw.\n\nIt was the third collaboration between Joel and producer Phil Ramone, following The Stranger and 52nd Street.\n\nMore recently, the group Marmaduke Duke has used a sample of Sleeping with the Television On in their song Rubber Lover.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written by Billy Joel.\n\nSide A\n\n      1.
