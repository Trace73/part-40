He has been driven by the urge to explore new horizons ever since the known history began. The early travellers all set out on their jou rneys for a reason . The Egyptians, the Phoenicians and the Greeks travelled for trade just like the Europeans in later years.\nWith an eye on wealth , the European explorers succeeded in charting much of the rest of the globe. Every continent has been explored, from the tropical jungles to the icy poles.
