It is named after the 1969 Fassbinder film Liebe ist kÃƒÂ¤lter als der Tod. The band's music is characterized by its extensive use of both romantic and classical styled male and female vocals. Founded by Ralf Donis, Maik Hartung, Sven Mertens, and Susann Heinrich in 1990, the band members and music have changed slightly since then. The first few LICTD albums were released on the Hyperium record label in Europe and on the new Metropolis Records label in the United States.\n\nThe band's album Teignmouth was the first Metropolis Records release, and remains one of LICTD's more popular albums. Following the departure of Donis, the more experimental songs that characterized some of the early LICTD work gave way to a much more classical sound. Eclipse, the latest LICTD album with new content, reached number one on Mexican New Age Sales Charts.\n\nAt present, the band is based in Leipzig, Germany. The band performed at major international festivals including, Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2003 and 2005 and the annual Bach Festival Leipzig in 2003.\n\nDiscography:\n\nFull length albums and EPs\n\nWild World Hyperium vinyl EP (1991)\nTeignmouth Hyperium Records / Metropolis Records (1991)\nMental Traveller Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1992)\nOxeia Hyperium / Metropolis Records (1994)\nSpellbound Hyperium CDS (1995)\nAtopos Chrom (1999)\nEclipse In Deyagora Music (2003)\nTempest In Deyagora Music (2013)\n\nSpecial releases\n\nTwo Faces But No Guitars (1990) -- MC limited to 20 copies\nAuter Hyperium (1995) -- collection CD\nInside the Bell (2004) -- live album limited\nTime (2006) 2CD In Deyagora MusicÃ¢â‚¬â€collection CD limited to 1,000 copies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd5bd5ec2e32d0e5dc54c486802d4227d8d985de","amp;dn":"Love+Is+Colder+Than+Death+-+Auter+-+A+Compilation+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd5bd5ec2e32d0e5dc54c486802d4227d8d985de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,91,213,236,46,50,208,229,220,84,196,134,128,45,66,39,216,217,133,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
