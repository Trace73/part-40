The last four episodes are part of the Namek Saga in the edited line of episodes. Unlike some of the following sets, this set does not feature any redubbing whatsoever except for one of Vegeta's lines during the Goku Vs. Vegeta fight where he is inconsistent in his pronunciation of &quot;Kaio-ken&quot; (though the original recorded line is still present for the US Music track). As such, many old errors remain uncorrected (Planet Vegeta being destroyed 3 years ago, Snake Way only being 10,000 miles, etc.) This DVD set is also the region 1 debut of the FUNimation dub and uncut version of Episodes 28-39.
