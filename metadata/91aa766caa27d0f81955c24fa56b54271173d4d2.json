The author sets out from the crisis in classical physics and explores the seminal ideas of Einstein, Bohr, and de Broglie and their vital importance for the development of quantum mechanics. There follows a bottom-up presentation of the postulates of quantum mechanics through real experiments (such as those of neutron interferometry), with consideration of their most important consequences, including applications in the field of atomic physics. A final chapter is devoted to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics, and particularly those aspects that are still open and hotly debated, to end up with a mention to Bell's theorem and Aspect's experiments","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91aa766caa27d0f81955c24fa56b54271173d4d2","amp;dn":"Lectures+in+Quantum+Mechanics+-+Luigi+E.+Picasso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91aa766caa27d0f81955c24fa56b54271173d4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,170,118,108,170,39,208,248,25,85,194,79,165,107,84,39,17,115,212,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
