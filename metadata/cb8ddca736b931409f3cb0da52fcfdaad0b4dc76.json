Certain Sculptures was released in 1985 and is one of the best albums of this style that came out in the 80s. New wave/rock bands of that era had a certain formula; guitars and synths and melodic tunes. Certain Sculptures is a must have album and just goes to show how much good stuff came out in the 80s but left unnoticed and neglected.\n\n\nA Drop In The Gray - Certain Sculptures [1985]\n\n01 All the Same\n\n02 Wide Eyed One\n\n03 Fall and Cry\n\n04 Heartache Feeds Heartache\n\n05 A Place For You\n\n06 Past Your Frame\n\n07 No Light\n\n08 Only Love\n\n09 Turn Me &amp;#039;Round\n\n10 Be There\n\n11 Alles Dasselbe\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb8ddca736b931409f3cb0da52fcfdaad0b4dc76","amp;dn":"A+Drop+In+The+Gray+-+Certain+Sculptures+%5B1985%5D+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb8ddca736b931409f3cb0da52fcfdaad0b4dc76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,141,220,167,54,185,49,64,159,60,176,218,82,252,253,170,208,180,220,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
