He accomplishes this resoundingly through both his music and art. As a multi-talented guitarist, singer-songwriter, and visual artist, Shawn weaves music, song, and painting into a richly textured experience that calls for enlightened activism.\n\nIn his latest release, Love Will Overcome, Shawn moves from the individual healing focus of his previous release, I Choose Love, to address community, global healing and restoration. Shawn says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“It is about raising awareness and empowering people to take actionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. These songs highlight healing for the peace movement, the environment, our political system, communities and relationships and are delivered with a passionate plea for loving action. This recording features theme songs written for organizations including the Peace Alliance, New Energy Movement, Go Gratitude, and the Satyana Institute.\n\n\nI Choose Love: The Experience is a multimedia production that follows the soulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healing journey through pain, confusion and struggle to emerge into the freedom of self-awareness, purpose, compassion, and joy. It includes songs, stories, dance, drama, photography, computer animation, film, and a series of original paintings that brings together the love of eight individuals as they transform their fears into a beautiful mosaic of forgiveness, peace and healing.  This theatrical piece is currently in pre-production.\n\nShawn Gallaway &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shawngallaway.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shawngallaway.com&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586a6f63070eeca364a6dfdb96b88ac3042342df","amp;dn":"Shawn+Gallaway+-+I+Choose+Love_MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586a6f63070eeca364a6dfdb96b88ac3042342df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,106,111,99,7,14,236,163,100,166,223,219,150,184,138,195,4,35,66,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
