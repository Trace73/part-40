The new series &quot;Monographs in Electrochemistry&quot; will fill this gap by publishing in-depth monographs written by experienced and distinguished electrochemists, covering both theory and applications. The focus is set on existing as well as emerging methods for researchers, engineers, and practitioners active in the many and often interdisciplinary fields, where electrochemistry plays a key role. These fields will range â€“ among others â€“ from analytical and environmental sciences to sensors, materials sciences and biochemical research","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:324b1362ca564763d2ef25a0161de2f444342836","amp;dn":"Monographs+in+Electrochemistry+%5BUpdated+at+2015.12.17%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"324b1362ca564763d2ef25a0161de2f444342836","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,75,19,98,202,86,71,99,210,239,37,160,22,29,226,244,68,52,40,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
