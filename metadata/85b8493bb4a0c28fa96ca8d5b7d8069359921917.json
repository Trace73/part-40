The group of twenty-somethings is forced to spend the night in an old abandoned witches' prison. During a Ouija Board sÃƒÂ©ance, the schoolmates accidentally unearth three dead executioners from their graves. A little confused, and quite a bit angry, the Crypt Keepers initiate a killing spree that will only end when everyone is dead. Fortunately, the schoolmates all wore black. Too bad it's for their own funerals... \n\n\nR, 1 hr. 30 min.\nHorror\nDirected By: David DeCoteau , Ellen Cabot\nIn Theaters: Jan 20, 2002 Wide\nOn DVD: Mar 8, 2005\nFull Moon\n\n\nDebra Mayer\nMichael Guerin \nPatrick Flood \nAlicia Arden \nJeff Peterson \nSamuel Page \nKim Ryan \nSam Page \n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1872/rZjOGGAp.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/1872/rZjOGGAp.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Dead Hate the Living\n\n\nWhen a renegade band of young filmmakers break into an abandoned hospital to make their horror epic, they stumble upon a real dead body and decide to use it in their movie. They accidentally bring it back to life, open a portal to a dead world that releases dozens of other zombies, then struggle for their lives in a desperate attempt to flee from the creatures who apparently have them hopelessly trapped in the hospital.\n\n\nEric Clawson as David Poe\nJamie Donahue as Topaz\nBrett Beardslee as Paul\nWendy Speake as Shelly Poe\nBenjamin P.

Reese (Jessica Morris) and Danni (Ariana Madix) are looking for a house to restore and sell when they happen across a Hollywood chateau once owned by Rose Pettigrew (Jean Louise O'Sullivan), a silent-era icon who was dumped by the studios following the transition to sound, and embarked on a suicidal murder rampage that claimed the lives of comic Tubby Fitzgerald (Nihilist Gelo), horror legend Erik Burke (Robert Zachar), and cowboy legend Sonny Barnes (Eric Roberts). Decades later, that dark history still looms heavy in those cavernous hallways. At first Reese and Danni think they've stumbled into the deal of a lifetime. And they couldn't be more right, because this house is haunted, and odds are they'll never live to find anything better. \n\nUnrated, 1 hr. 18 min.\nHorror\nDirected By: Charles Band\n\n\nAriana Madix-Danni\nJean Louise O'Sullivan\nCircus Szalewski \nRobert Zachar \nNihilist Gelo \nEric Roberts-Sonny Barnes\n\n\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/228/lLnzJy9J.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://lookpic.com/O/i2/228/lLnzJy9J.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b8493bb4a0c28fa96ca8d5b7d8069359921917","amp;dn":"Full+Moon+Features-Undead+Pack-zombiRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b8493bb4a0c28fa96ca8d5b7d8069359921917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,184,73,59,180,160,194,143,169,108,168,213,183,216,6,147,89,146,25,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
