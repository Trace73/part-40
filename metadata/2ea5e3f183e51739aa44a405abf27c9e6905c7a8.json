His father created the mega-popular Tommy Taylor boy-wizard fantasy novels. But dad modeled the fictional epic so closely to Tom that fans constantly compare him to his counterpart, turning him into a lame, Z-level celebrity.\n\nWhen a scandal hints that Tom might really be the boy-wizard made flesh, Tom comes into contact with a mysterious, deadly group that's secretly kept tabs on him all his life. Now, to protect his life and discover the truth behind his origins, Tom will travel the world, to all the places in world history where fictions have shaped reality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ea5e3f183e51739aa44a405abf27c9e6905c7a8","amp;dn":"The+Unwritten+1+-+31.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ea5e3f183e51739aa44a405abf27c9e6905c7a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,165,227,241,131,229,23,57,170,68,164,5,171,242,124,158,105,5,199,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
