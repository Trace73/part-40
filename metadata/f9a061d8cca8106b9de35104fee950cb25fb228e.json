Ttime flies in the countdown to one&amp;#039;s own death. Every day brings that predestined day closer. Death surely eradicates all ambitions, greed and desires for this world. Under the soil, neither possessions nor status prevail. Every possession with which we are being stingy, including the body, will also vanish and decay in the earth. Whether one is poor or wealthy, beautiful or ugly, one will be wrapped in a simple shroud one day. We believe that The Truth of the Life of this World offers an explanation regarding the real nature of human life. It is a short and deceptive life in which worldly desires seem fascinating and full of promise, but the truth is otherwise. This site will enable you to perceive your life and all of its realities, and help you reconsider your goals in life, if you want to.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9a061d8cca8106b9de35104fee950cb25fb228e","amp;dn":"TRUTH+OF+THIS+WORLD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9a061d8cca8106b9de35104fee950cb25fb228e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,160,97,216,204,168,16,107,157,227,81,4,254,233,80,203,37,251,34,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
