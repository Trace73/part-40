But a fellow bowler,\nErnie McCracken and a misunderstanding with some rough\npunks, leaves poor Roy with the loss of his bowling hand!\nNot to let this get him down, he gets a prosthetic hand\nand becomes a travelling sales man. But it's really all\ndown hill for him from that night on until ... One day he\nmeets Ishmael who is Amish and sneaks away from the farm\nto bowl (his fellow Amish would disown him if they knew)!\nRoy convinces Ishmael to let him be his trainer and he'll\nmake him the best bowler the world has ever seen.\nReluctantly Ishmael agrees to go on the road and shortly\nafterwards actually finds that life outside the farm is\nquite fun.
