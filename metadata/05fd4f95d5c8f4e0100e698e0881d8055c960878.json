The seventh child of the Jackson family, he made his dÃƒÂ½but to the professional music scene at the age of 11 as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1969, and began a solo career in 1971 while still a member of the group. Referred to as the &quot;King of Pop&quot; in subsequent years, his 1982 album Thriller is the world's best-selling record of all time and four other solo studio albums are also among the world's best-selling records: Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991) and HIStory (1995).\n\nIn the early 1980s, he became a dominant figure in popular music and the first African-American entertainer to amass a strong crossover following on MTV. The popularity of his music videos airing on MTV, such as &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and Thriller widely credited with transforming the music video from a promotional tool into an art form helped bring the relatively new channel to fame. Videos such as &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; made Jackson an enduring staple on MTV in the 1990s. With stage performances and music videos, Jackson popularized a number of physically complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk. His distinctive musical sound and vocal style influenced many hip hop, pop and contemporary R&amp;B artists. While Jackson was a member of Generation Jones, he had an impact on multiple generations.\n\nJackson donated and raised millions of dollars for beneficial causes through his foundation, charity singles and support of 39 charities. Other aspects of his personal life, including his changing appearance and behavior, generated significant controversy, damaging his public image. Though he was accused of child sexual abuse in 1993, the criminal investigation was closed due to lack of evidence and Jackson was not charged. The singer had experienced health concerns since the early 1990s and conflicting reports regarding the state of his finances since the late 1990s. Jackson married twice and fathered three children, all of which caused further controversy. In 2005, Jackson was tried and acquitted of further sexual abuse allegations and several other charges.\n\nOne of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, his other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records including one for &quot;Most Successful Entertainer of All Time&quot;13 Grammy Awards, 13 number one singles in his solo career more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era and the sale of 750 million records worldwide. Jackson's highly publicized personal life, coupled with his successful career, made him a part of popular culture for almost four decades. Jackson died on June 25, 2009, aged 50. The specific cause of death is yet to be determined. Before his death, Jackson had announced a 50 date sell-out This Is It comeback tour, in London, England.\n\nThis Pack Contains:\n\n1.

Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael Jackson travel all over the world singing their biggest hits and going on wacky adventures as well. Following the success of &quot;The Beatles,&quot; ABC again used the formula for this series. Animated by Rankin/Bass (best known for their stop-motion holiday specials), the series was made at the height of psychedelic animation following &quot;The Yellow Submarine&quot; -- and each episode featured at least one song montage accentuated by dazzling visuals. Unlike the Beatles' series, the Jacksons were themselves participants in the creation. Michael, enamoured by being involved in fairy tales, was said to have given a lot of creative input. In the '80s, as Michael Jackson's popularity soared, this series was resurrected by many cable and network TV stations. In the '90s, while Michael was still known as &quot;the reigning King of Pop,&quot; the series was dusted off again for airings on MTV and VH1.\n\n/Jackson 5ive - 01 - It All Started With.....

After giving HBO massive ratings, and then again on subsequent channels around the world, it was only inevitable that it would have to get a DVD release sooner or later.\n\nIncluded on the DVD are some of Michael's biggest hits, ranging from Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat It to Man In The Mirror.\n\nThe concert begins with something called &quot;The Toaster Entrance&quot; this hit headlines around the world, as it saw Michael being catapulted onto the stage to a massive ovation, to start off with the song Jam.\n\nThis possibly is the most amazing mix of Choreography and singing that goes together so well, that you will get goose-bumps just watching Michael's presence on stage. The most annoying parts of the concert, would have to be the crowd shots, i mean why buy a concert to see those amazing dance moves in action, only to be shown shots of girls fainting and crying.\n\nFan or Not, just about anyone will like this concert, as it documents Michael at his highest peak. Either-way it's a great thing to check out.\n\nTracks:\n1. Main Title\n2. Jam\n3. Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\n4. Human Nature\n5. Smooth Criminal\n6. I Just Can't Stop Loving You\n7.
