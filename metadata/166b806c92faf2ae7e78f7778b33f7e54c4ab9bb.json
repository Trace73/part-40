Schreiber, PhD, and Eric S. Lander, PhD, open a window onto the fast-paced world of genomic science and chemical genetics. They emphasize how molecular biology, robotics, and advanced computation, combined with intense teamwork, characterize a new generation of biomedical research. Dr. Schreiber is an HHMI investigator, Morris Loeb Professor, and chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University. Dr. Lander is director of the Whitehead Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome Research and professor of biology at MIT.\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat: MKV\r\nFrame Size: 720 x 480\r\nBitrate: 3725 kbps\r\nFrame Rate: 29.97fps\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nRate and Size: 48000 HZ 16 bit\r\nBitrate: 192 kbps\r\nChannel: 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:166b806c92faf2ae7e78f7778b33f7e54c4ab9bb","amp;dn":"HHMI.Scanning+Lifes+Matrix+-Genes%2C+proteins%2C+and+small+molecule","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"166b806c92faf2ae7e78f7778b33f7e54c4ab9bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,107,128,108,146,250,242,174,126,120,247,119,139,51,247,229,76,74,185,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
