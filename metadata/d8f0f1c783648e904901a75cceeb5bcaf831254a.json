Many other synths sound great and does exactly what i want, but they also often do alot more than that. WAY MORE! So i decided to back it down a bit and create a compact monophonic synth with a lot of control over phase and the generated waveforms. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s retrig on all oscÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and that combined with the various elements regarding waveform modulation, opens up for more fun in creating new sounds fast.\n\nThe gui and everything else are work in progress.\n\n/Marcus Bits\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8f0f1c783648e904901a75cceeb5bcaf831254a","amp;dn":"Kaliber+0.5+Beta+Synth+VST+%28Win+32-bit%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8f0f1c783648e904901a75cceeb5bcaf831254a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,240,241,199,131,100,142,144,73,1,167,92,206,235,91,202,248,49,37,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
