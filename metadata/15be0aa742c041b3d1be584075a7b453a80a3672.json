It is the actual plug-in &quot;container&quot;:\n\n   Plug-in Volume level control;\n   Plug-in Pan level control;\n   Plug-in Dry/Wet (Mix) level control;\n   Plug-in Program selector;\n   Plug-in Editor display button;\n   Plug-in L/R-channel volume indicators.\n\nVIRTUAL DEVICE RACK\n\nDevice &quot;container&quot;. It is used for mounting multiple Devices in a stack manner:\n\n   Input module;\n   Unlimited number of Devices as FX-chain &quot;links&quot;;\n   Output module;\n   Free in-rack Device reposition.\n\nVIRTUAL RACKS BATTERY\n\nRacks &quot;container&quot;. It is used for multiple Racks aggregation in a battery manner:\n\n   32 separate Racks;\n   Free cross-rack Device reposition;\n   Gesture navigation between Racks.\n\nVIRTUAL MIXER\n\nBattery signals routing and control unit. It is used for mixing, switching, changing the levels of audio-streams and so on:\n\n   32 separate mixer Channels;\n   Volume level control;\n   Pan level control;\n   Send level control;\n   Mute-switcher;\n   Solo-switcher;\n   FX on/off-switcher;\n   Input (Left or Right) audio channel selector;\n   L/R-channel volume indicators.\n\nUSER PLUG-INS LIST AT HAND\n\nProvides fast access to the audio plug-ins, installed on the user's machine:\n\n   DXi (under development);\n   VST2;\n   VST3;\n   ReWire;\n   V-RAXTOR plug-ins (under development).\n\nPROGRAM ASSETS BROWSER\n\nProvides fast access to the program assets, stored by user:\n\n   Stored Projects;\n   Stored Devices;\n   Stored Racks;\n   Stored Mixer States;\n   Stored Workspaces.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n1 GHz CPU, 512 MB RAM, 20 MB HDD, DirectSound/ASIO-compatible audio interface, OpenGL3.3/Direct3D10/11\n\nSupported Sample Formats (loads or saves) include\nFLAC, MP3, OGG, WAV\n\n\nInstallation\n\n1.Uninstall previous versions.\n2.Install V-RAXTOR.\n3.Copy R2RVRAX.dll to the installation dir.\n4.Run our EmuTool.\n5.Patch V-Raxtor.exe.\n6.Generate License Key.\n7.Run V-RAXTOR and activate.\n You can activate from Help -&gt; About.\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
