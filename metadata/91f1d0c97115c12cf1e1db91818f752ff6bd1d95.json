One moment, customers are happily shopping in the Save-A-Lot grocery store. The next instant, they are transformed into bloodthirsty psychotics, interested only in slaughtering one another and committing unimaginably atrocious and frenzied acts of violent depravity. Only Jack, Sammi, Angie and Marcel seem immune to the insanity that has infected the rest of the town. But can they stay alive long enough -- and trust each other long enough -- to unravel the secret of Jack's magic beans...\n\nDeadite Press is proud to bring one of Brian Keene's bleakest and most violent novellas back into print once more.\n\nThis edition also includes four bonus short stories: &quot;Without You&quot;, &quot;I Am An Exit&quot;, &quot;This Is Not An Exit&quot;, and &quot;The King, in: YELLOW&quot;.\n\nepub,mobi and txt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91f1d0c97115c12cf1e1db91818f752ff6bd1d95","amp;dn":"Jacks+Magic+Beans+And+4+Other+Stories+By+Brian+Keene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91f1d0c97115c12cf1e1db91818f752ff6bd1d95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,241,208,201,113,21,193,44,241,225,219,145,129,143,117,47,246,189,29,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
