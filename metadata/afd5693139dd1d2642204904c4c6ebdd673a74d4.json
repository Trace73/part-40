I made a commented in one of my recent threads that because my music collection is quite vast, it's nearly impossible for me to even listen to a small portion of my collection.  A collection that continues to grow daily.\n\nLike all of you, I too have my favorites that I tend to keep in my stereo.  Artists, songs, and albums that are tried and true to the genres I have naturally migrated to over the years.  But that doesn't mean I don't enjoy new music.  I certainly do.  I'll listen to anything that praises God above.  Amen?\n\nWhat I would like to do is create a 30, or so, song mixtape to listen to in my vehicle.  And that's where I need your help.  I would like you to suggest 3 songs by any artist, genre, or year.  I will pick your first 2 songs from that list, and include it on my mixtape.  If I don't have one of the first 2 songs from your list, that's where your 3rd selection will come in play.\n\nAs I said, I want this to be diverse.  After all, it's intended to be an introduction to new music which I might not otherwise listen to.  So if there happens to be some hardcore followed by bluegrass, followed by some chants, then so be it.  Anything goes!  But please don't simply pick your favorite (or widely played songs from the radio).  I would like your selections to complement the variety I am trying to achieve on this mixtape.\n\nI'll include a couple of songs myself.  And once the mixtape is complete, I'll identify each of you who contributed the song, create some simple artwork, and torrent it here on The Pirate Bay for others to also download and enjoy.\n\nNow, getting back to today's torrent...\n\nWe're up to 1,480 releases for 2013.  And the genre breakdown might look something like this...\n\nPOP: Anthem Lights, Code Of Ethics, Michael Sykes, Warr Acres.  JAZZ: Ben Tankard.  HIP-HOP/RAP: Champion The City, D-Tropp, LockDown, Puntin, Queen Coco, Remnant, Swae.  ALTERNATIVE: City Lights, Flagship.  PRAISE &amp; WORSHIP: Don Moen, Valley Creek Worship, Vineyard.  PUNK: Five Iron Frenzy.  COUNTRY: Grits And Soul.  SINGER-SONGWRITER: James.  ROCK: The Letter Black, Superchick.  HARDCORE/METAL: Living Sacrifice.  CHRISTMAS: Various North Point.
