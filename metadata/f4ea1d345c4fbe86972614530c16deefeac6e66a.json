In 1940 on a world besieged by World War II, Wendy, now grown up, has two children, one of them is her daughter, Jane. She wears her trench coat during the air raid, and later that night, Wendy tries to give her own children hope by telling them of her magical experiences with Peter Pan in Never Land. However, Jane, Wendy's daughter, sees it all as make believe and refuses to believe in the tales. That is, until the villainous Captain Hook mistakes her for Wendy and abducts her to Never Land in an attempt to lure and capture Peter Pan. Peter Pan's quest to return Jane safely home is jeopardized until she can begin to believe in the magic of imagination. In London during World War II, this is the story of Wendy's daughter, Jane, who is kidnapped by Captain Hook and Peter Pan must come to the rescue.\n\nInfo &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/44743701890116281660.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/44743701890116281660.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nScreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/08699810721442116690.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/08699810721442116690.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/97007512889034245605.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/97007512889034245605.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/89310323535598989388.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/89310323535598989388.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/39881960667266793870.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/39881960667266793870.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/07659439113435711480.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leetleech.org/images/07659439113435711480.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote All User :\nI Have Tested This On\nThe VLC Media Player And Media Player Classic And Works Fine.\nWe hope you enjoy this release.\n\nPlease seed, and we thank you for your support.\nADD REPS IF U LIKE MY WORK\n\nYOUR REPLY APPRECIATED WITH OVER WORK SO KINDLY PLZ DO\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4ea1d345c4fbe86972614530c16deefeac6e66a","amp;dn":"Peter+Pan++Never+Land+2002+BRRip+480p+Eng-Hindi+SDR-Release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4ea1d345c4fbe86972614530c16deefeac6e66a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,234,29,52,92,79,190,134,151,38,20,83,12,22,222,239,234,198,230,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
