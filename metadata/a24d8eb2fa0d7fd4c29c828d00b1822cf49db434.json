One of the best soundtracks ever released and is beautifully haunting. - Big Papi\n\n\n\nBy A Customer\n&quot;The Crow&quot; soundtrack (which is dedicated to the memory of the late Brandon Lee who died while filming the movie and will always be remembered by the part he plays, whether he likes it or not) opens with a spellbinding, quintessential &quot;Crow&quot; song: &quot;Burn&quot; by The Cure, a song linked to the transformational movie scene where Eric Draven (Lee) decorates himself in white foundation, black leather and lipstick after revisiting his trashed apartment. Machines of Loving Grace's &quot;Golgotha Tenement Blues&quot; (#2) and Nine Inch Nails' &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (#4) follow in this same ambiance, keeping with the dark moodiness of the film. The heavier, more aggressive side to this soundtrack can found in tracks like [#9] &quot;The Badge&quot; by Pantera, [#10] &quot;Slip Slide Melting&quot; by For Love Not Lisa, and [#11] &quot;After the Flesh&quot; by My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult--all favorites of mine. After this last song, I generally turn the CD off before the remaining three sappy tracks, which wrap up with the Jane Siberry tune that's titled after the words in the movie: &quot;It can't rain all the time.&quot; If you're a fan of this 1994 dark fantasy--or you just like the majority of alternative rock bands/artists on here--then this soundtrack is certainly worth owning. It's a great piece of &quot;The Crow&quot; nostalgia.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVA - The Crow\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 66 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
