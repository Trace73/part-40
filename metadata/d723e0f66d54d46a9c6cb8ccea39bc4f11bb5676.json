Ã¢â‚¬Å“A lot of times you ask yourself, Ã¢â‚¬ËœAre we doing the right thing?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a simple question, but also profound. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always wondering if weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re moving in the right direction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMusically, the trio has nothing to worry about. They bravely continue to forge ahead on the right path. Approaching timeless rock structures through a healthy amount of experimentation and instrumental intricacy, the group takes flight locked and loaded with unforgettable hooks and impressive delivery.  ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a combination that instantly impacts and takes up residence inside your head as all great hard rock should.\n\nAfter releasing their self-titled debut in 2009, Owl captivated audiences alongside the likes of Helmet and Jet to Hollywood all-star rock collective Camp Freddy. Between touring and recording commitments with WyseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s other gig Ã¢â‚¬â€œ playing bass in The Cult Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Owl began writing what would become the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s self-produced The Right Thing in early 2011. Sessions took place in Matt SorumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Drac Studios in Los Angeles as well as at DinsmoreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own O Studios in the mountains of upstate New York.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Although the first album was heavy and bombastic, I feel like our new record is even more engaging and exhilarating on various levels,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dinsmore reveals. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an honesty that shines through. We were all in the moment, and it shows. If you let it, this record will take you on a wild ride.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe title track boasts a propulsive drumbeat that drives into staggering distortion as Wyse muses,Ã¢â‚¬Å“You couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t handle. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re tripping. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t trust yourselfÃ¢â‚¬Å“. The song teeters between brooding and hypnotic as the band roars to life.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, they transform The KinksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“DestroyerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into a swaggering futuristic stomper. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a classic energy, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still unequivocally Owl.\n\nElsewhere on the album, Wyse delves into his Irish roots on the rousing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rover,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and welcomes guest drummer Johnny Tempesta of The Cult on the electrifying, tribal beat-driven Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Day.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“PerfectÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ contemplates a perfect day over an ethereal soundscape flush with emotion. Wyse shares, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sometimes you have those special moments where everything feels perfect. You get a flash of clarity and are able to reach another level. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about cherishing those simple times when the dark parts of life just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMezilis concludes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“We approach music in a slightly unorthodox way, but our aim has always been to take listeners places theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never been before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s undeniably The Right Thing for Owl and listeners everywhere.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d723e0f66d54d46a9c6cb8ccea39bc4f11bb5676","amp;dn":"Owl-+Owl+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d723e0f66d54d46a9c6cb8ccea39bc4f11bb5676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,35,224,246,109,84,212,106,156,108,184,204,234,57,188,79,17,187,86,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
