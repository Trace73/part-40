If you try to drag and drop windows will just make a short cut, so make sure to use copy and paste.)\n\nRun the shortcut for Bon Voyage and enjoy. \nIf it doesnt work\nRun the patch file sims2ep6_patch.exe and re copy and paste the file Sims2EP6.exe into your TSBin directory of the Bon Voyage install AGAIN. (it will have changed).\n\nDouble click the Bon Voyage Shortcut on your desktop again. And hope it works.\n\nFYI: when you first run the game, give it a good 5 minutes to load (not including the video) before you decide its broken. It can take quite a while to load up so be patient, grab a hot cup of tea and watch Eastenders.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688f9366a5642332b0728a5948163253c776acab","amp;dn":"Sims+2+Bon+Voyage","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688f9366a5642332b0728a5948163253c776acab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,143,147,102,165,100,35,50,176,114,138,89,72,22,50,83,199,118,172,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
