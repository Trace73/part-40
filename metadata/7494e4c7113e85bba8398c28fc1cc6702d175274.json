It packs a new confifuration settings that can be handled by users of any level of experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike other simular apps which return the old Startmenu and Button, the side menu of StartisBack is transparant ansd highlights every new program in the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to functionality, StartisBack integrates some useful features. For example: if you search the computer for a new item, this is instandly shown in the results area (if it was previously indexed by Windows).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have mentioned before, StartisBack comes with a multitude of configuration settings: these concern the Startmenu items and behavior (e.g. display My Computer as a link, hide Default Programs and Device and Printers), appearance (e.g. disable taskbar translucency, hide the Startbutton) and switching rules (e.g. show the Desktop when logging onto the PC, switch to the last used application when clicking the Startscreen).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther options refer to uncluttering items in the Startscreen (by remaining the Startscreen to â€œAppsâ€ and by keeping only the modern apps in that location), the advanced system commands menu (combine the Startbutton context menu with the one of the Startscreen) and Windows tweaks (e.g. store and display opened recently programs). Furthermore, you can disable StartisBack for the current user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStartisBack does not put a strain on the computers overall performance, as it uses a pretty low amount of CPU and system memory. It is pretty responsive to key strokes and mouse commands. I have not encountered any issues throughout my testing: StartisBack did not hang, crash or display error dialogs. Thanks to itâ€™s intuitive yet rich features, the application should please users of all skill levels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges in 1.2.1 for Windows 10:\r\n\r\n- Support for newer Insider Builds\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDonâ€™t hit and run! A minimum seed time required, the maximum seed time desired. Please seed for as long as you are able to keep this torrtent alive!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7494e4c7113e85bba8398c28fc1cc6702d175274","amp;dn":"StartisBack%2B%2B+1.2.1+Pre-Activated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7494e4c7113e85bba8398c28fc1cc6702d175274","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,148,228,199,17,62,133,187,168,57,140,40,252,28,198,112,45,23,82,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
