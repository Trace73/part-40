This book draws on a wide range of contemporary and modern sources to look behind the figure of legend to find Wallace's true character. \n\nIt traces Wallace's journey from his modest upbringing in south-west Scotland and his first victory as a &quot;guerilla&quot; leader and military commander at Stirling Bridge to his painful death seven years later, including his &quot;invasion&quot; of Northumberland and Cumberland. This is an essential traveling companion for a journey through Wallace's kingdom and to learn more about the myth and the man.\n\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8429cb83f3bd3fd52b365962753b69646ab5542","amp;dn":"In+the+Footsteps+of+William+Wallace+by+Alan+Young","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8429cb83f3bd3fd52b365962753b69646ab5542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,66,156,184,63,59,211,253,82,179,101,150,39,83,182,150,70,171,85,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
