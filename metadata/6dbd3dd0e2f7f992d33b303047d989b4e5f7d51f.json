The Story of Dumb George\n\n\nThis admittedly is one of my more bizarre album assemblages, originally began as a joke by a friend of mine that morphed into a dare.  He jested that it couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be done; challenge accepted!  Thus, this is my Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½reimaginationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of what could have been Van MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, recorded solo for the sole purpose of fulfilling his contract with Bang Records in 1968.  Aptly titled Contractual Obligations, I have taken the 31 Ã¢â‚¬Å“revenge songsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that Van Morrison recorded, organized them by musical key and lyrical theme, and edited the fragments together to create thirteen more-or-less complete songs and sequenced them into a semblance of a an album. \n\nLet Van Morrison be an example of the plight of young artists by the hands of corporate greed and exploitation.  Hastily signing to himself to Bang Records in 1967 in order to avoid literal starvation, Morrison recorded an albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of material he didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel amounted to an actual album.  He left the March 1967 recording sessions thinking that those eight songsÃ¢â‚¬â€one of them his immensely popular hit Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brown Eyed GirlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€would be released as four separate singles.  Instead, Bang Records collected the songs and released them as Van MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, Blowin Your Mind.  Not only was this done completely without his consent, but Bang promoted the album in full psychedelic fashion, an image Morrison himself detested.  To make matters worse, label head Burt BernsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ passing in December allowed for his widow Ilene to impose ridiculous performance restrictions on Morrison, all which were allowed by the contract that he himself signed.\n\n\nVan MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s salvation lied within a simple loophole in his contract: deliver 36 original songs to Bang Records.  And so sometime in early 1968, Van Morrison entered a recording studio and performed 31 intentionally half-assed bullshit songs in order to escape the clutches of Ilene Berns.  The songs were all musically simple--often I-IV-V progressions in E or GÃ¢â‚¬â€and the lyrics presumably improvised, meaningless, random, inane.  Some were even gibberish.  Morrison had farted out over thirty nonsense songs that were all completely unusable in an act of musical revenge, which fulfilled his contract.  Bang Records refused to release them at the time but the collection eventually appeared as rare bonus material on legally-questionable international anthology releases throughout the years.\n\nFor my reimagination, we will postulate how Bang could have assembled these throwaway fragments into some sort of cohesive album.  A listen through the material will tell you that Morrison did not put much thought into the Ã¢â‚¬Å“compositionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ musically and they follow similar chord sequences, all standard open chords within the same harmonic family.  We are thus able to easily group most of the songs together by key.  Even luckier, many of those musically-similar compositions share similar lyrical qualities, further identifying possible associations.  Although this was undoubtedly unintentional by Van, we can exploit this tendency and edit these similar fragments together, creating full songs from the fragments.  Using the 31 fragments I was able to create eleven complete songs, leaving two fragments to remain their own stand-alone songs. \n\nSide A begins with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Savoy HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is a combination of the songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do ItÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½,&quot;Go For YourselfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Savoy HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  The beginning tape wow opens the album up mid-song and prepares us for VanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bumpy ride with strumming and vocal stutters.  Follows is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang On GroovyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“La MamboÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang On GroovyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, less a mockery of the classic songs Ã¢â‚¬Å“La BambaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hang On SloopyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but more a mockery of Bang for expecting something more than pop-song contrivance for this album.  The next four songs gather together MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inane send-ups of movement-centric 1950s rock nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll classics: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twist, Shake and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Twist and ShakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Shake and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stomp, Scream and HollerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stomp and ScreamÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scream and HollerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jump, Thump and JiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Jump and ThumpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Drivin WheelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk, Wobble and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk and TalkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½The WobbleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wobble and RollÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).  The fact that these song are all in a row should drive home how ridiculous this album is, and without the proper mindset is a very painful listen.  Van Morrison himself agrees, as the closing song on side A is the stand-alone Ã¢â‚¬Å“Freaky If You Got This FarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which it truly is.\n\nSide B starts with an explanation of the album itself: Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Big Royalty CheckÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which is a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big Royalty CheckÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thirty TwoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“All The BitsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  Following is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blowin Your NoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blow In Your NoseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nose In You BlowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a mockery of the first album that Morrison never approved of.  Ã¢â‚¬Å“Want A Danish?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Want A DanishÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Chickie CooÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) is followed by more silliness in Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake It MableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake It MableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½You Say France and I WhistleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Up In Your MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).  The most noteworthy of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“revenge songsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ follows, the stand-alone Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ring WormÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.  To end Contractual Obligations, I united all four songs about the character Dumb George and sequenced them in a logical and presumably chronological order, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Story of Dumb GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (a combination of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here Comes Dumb GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dum Dum GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hold On GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Goodbye GeorgeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½).  The icing on this distasteful cake is the original artwork by EAB, in which Bang RecordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ contrived psychdelicism is literally consuming Van Morrison.\n\nIs this a good album?  Oh, God no, this album is fucking awful!  But intentionally awful, for good reason, and thus worth a listen.  It is an absurd album, especially knowing who this isÃ¢â‚¬â€this is Van Morrison, a genius who combined folk, jazz, soul and pop on his legendary Astral Weeks album, recorded under a year later from Contractual ObligationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ horrific nonsense.  With this in mind, itin t is a fascinating look at the effects of big business on artists, relevant even today.  Sometimes, cause is more relevant than effect and the context of the music is more interesting than the music itself.  Contractual Obligations shows us this as it lies somewhere between pain and pleasure but as an album that never was.  \n\n\nSources used: \nVan Morrison - New York Sessions 67 (1997 Recall Records)\n\n\nflac --&gt; wav --&gt; editing in SONAR &amp; Goldwave --&gt; flac encoding via TLH lv8\n*md5, artwork and tracknotes included\n\n3/22/14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dbd3dd0e2f7f992d33b303047d989b4e5f7d51f","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Contractual+Obligations+%5BAlbums+That+Never+Were%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dbd3dd0e2f7f992d33b303047d989b4e5f7d51f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,189,61,208,226,247,249,146,211,59,48,48,71,217,137,180,229,247,213,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
