Moom's panel appears, and you then click the desired action.\n\nWhen used via the keyboard, a hot key displays the Moom bezel, and you can then use the arrow and modifier keys to move and resize the windows.\n\nYou can also save window layouts, create custom controls with shortcuts that work globally or work only when Moom's keyboard bezel is onscreen.\n\nMy seventh upload!\n\nLet me know of any bugs in the comments below and if you like the torrent rate it up!!!\n\nPLEASE SEED! I will provide cake.\n\n-AppRipper \nHappy Hacking","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:879714fb1e15681c5aa923a2425058f737419422","amp;dn":"Moom+2.4.1+K%27d+MAC+APP+STORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"879714fb1e15681c5aa923a2425058f737419422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,151,20,251,30,21,104,28,90,169,35,162,66,80,88,247,55,65,148,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
