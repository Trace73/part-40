A city-dweller herself, Korenstein understands the limitations urban kitchens place upon todayâ€™s chefs: with limited counterspace, no dishwasher, and miniature appliances that make it difficult to prepare complicated recipes. Dining out or ordering food to-go all the time can become expensive; Korenstein helps home cooks reclaim their kitchens with simple recipes that address the need for low-cost, quick and healthy cooking, all while saving space.\r\n\r\n7x7 Cooking is broken down into six easy chapters: Salads and Starters, Chicken and Meat, Fish and Seafood, Pasta, Vegetables and Sides, and Foolproof Desserts. Korensteinâ€™s recipes focus on bold flavors and few ingredients so the pantry stays manageableâ€”and so readers avoid spending hours in the kitchen getting dinner together. With quick sautÃ©s, bakes, and broils, readers learn how to prepare easy and satisfying meals that the whole family will love. No space for a grill? Korenstein teaches you how to love your broiler. With a few helpful tips, cooking in a small kitchen has never been easier!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa81b18c95301260fe07411b885581e2f93b759b","amp;dn":"7x7+Cooking+-+The+Art+of+Cooking+in+a+Small+Kitchen+%282013%29Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa81b18c95301260fe07411b885581e2f93b759b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,129,177,140,149,48,18,96,254,7,65,27,136,85,129,226,249,59,117,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
