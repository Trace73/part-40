Artist and author Sue Williamson explores five decades of South African art, from early political art in the 1960s (during the apartheid years) to the thought-provoking works that grabbed the international art marketÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest a generation later. Featuring the work of 90 artists and more than 500 color images, and with an insightful foreword from Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer, South African Art Now is a valuable resource for collectors, curators, and contemporary art enthusiasts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c4bcba217730aed7c37d554badfa21248310d0f","amp;dn":"South+African+Art+Now+%28Art+Ebook%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c4bcba217730aed7c37d554badfa21248310d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,75,203,162,23,115,10,237,124,55,213,84,186,223,162,18,72,49,13,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
