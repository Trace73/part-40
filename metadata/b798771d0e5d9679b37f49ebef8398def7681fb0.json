Robert Ryan is Blaise Starrett, a man who wants open range and is going to kill Hal Crane, the husband of Helen (Tina Louise), because of barbed wire. When Jack Bruhn(Burl Ives) shows up with his gang, everything changes and they become prisoners in their own town. There is tremendous, violent impact in a scene where the women are obliged to dance with members of the gang. The situation becomes unbearable and Ryan will find a way out that might seem unreasonable at first, but when exposed by him to Bruhn will make a lot of sense. Andre De Toth directed many good westerns with Randolph Scott, but nothing compared to this one. Great cinematography in black and white by Russel Harlan, who also did The Last Hunt( there is something common in them). Good performances by David Nelson and Venetia Stevenson, both popular with teenagers of those times. A film not to be missed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b798771d0e5d9679b37f49ebef8398def7681fb0","amp;dn":"Day+of+the+Outlaw+%28Western%29+%7BRobert+Ryan%2C+Burl+Ives%7D+%5B1959%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b798771d0e5d9679b37f49ebef8398def7681fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,152,119,29,14,93,150,121,179,127,73,235,239,131,152,222,247,104,31,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
