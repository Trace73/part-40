This documentary sees how they cater to their super-rich clients in a world untouched by austerity. They include a catering company who charge more than Â£1,000 per head and a Welsh cattle farmer who massages his Japanese Wagyu cows as well as giving them beer to drink (to improve the characteristic marbling effect in their beef). The documentary also meets etiquette expert William Hanson, who travels the world teaching super-rich foreign clients how to negotiate the minefield of a dinner party.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b0/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/69/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a1/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/The-World-s-Most-Expensive-Food-Part-3-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3157 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 4\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.02 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/episode/dvnwyg/the-worlds-most-expensive-food\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20World%27s%20Most%20Expensive%20Food","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:066969670b7751549d5f40ab988659063d175c89","amp;dn":"Ch4+The+Worlds+Most+Expensive+Food+Part+3+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"066969670b7751549d5f40ab988659063d175c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,105,105,103,11,119,81,84,157,95,64,171,152,134,89,6,61,23,92,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
