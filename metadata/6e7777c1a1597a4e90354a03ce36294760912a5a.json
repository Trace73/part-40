When superstitious faiths like Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Shinto, Confucianism and Taoism are mentioned, people tend to think of religious communities who worship or pray to idols carved out of stone or wood, make offerings to and put on shows of seeming respect for them and perform mysterious ceremonies in dimly lit temples. Whereas Divine and monotheistic religions like Islam, Christianity and Judaism (Ã¢â‚¬â€œthe original state of Christianity and Judaism is referred to here as they have been tampered with and altered since their revelationÃ¢â‚¬â€) are based on revelation and call humanity to an enlightened, happy, safe and just life. The superstitious Eastern religions with their 1.5 billion believers1 worldwide, represent a gloomy life filled with pagan rituals, social injustices and miserable conditions, that is to say, a warped life.
