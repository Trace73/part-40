A fun, fascinating survey of abstract art, Journeys to Abstraction offers a behind-the-scenes look at how contemporary artists break free from literal depiction to rejoice in the pure expressive power of color, line and texture.\n\n    58 artists share 100 striking abstract paintings, along with the ideas, inspirations and diverse working processes behind them.\n    Covers a wide variety of traditional and non-traditional media and techniques, including watercolor, collage, acrylics, ink and more.\n    Four step-by-step demonstrations show how abstract pieces come together from start to finish.\n\nDiscover how artists paint, pour, scrape, spray, carve, stamp, collage and otherwise build complex layers of texture and meaning. Painting with egg cartons, turning acrylic paints into shards of &quot;stained glass,&quot; incorporating old &quot;failed&quot; paintings into fresh finished pieces...anything goes in abstract art! Marked by an inspiring freedom of form and content, this is a liberating book for any artist in search of new, dynamic forms of self-expression.\n\n\nThis is my first torrent.\nI hope this will work well.\n\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd, please seed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be687e47e7879795b56dca9cdc156f1e3a40e262","amp;dn":"Journeys+To+Abstraction%3A+100+Paintings+and+Their+Secrets+Reveale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be687e47e7879795b56dca9cdc156f1e3a40e262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,104,126,71,231,135,151,149,181,109,202,156,220,21,111,30,58,64,226,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
