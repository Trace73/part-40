His downfall came with the road rage killing of a stranger on the M25 circular motorway around London. He went on the run, but the police were not going to give up their search for him.\n\nNew posting of previous torrent, following loss of torrent files after an HDD failure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95e88d08f719bfac40dcd3ca8954748edba99a1f","amp;dn":"A+Killer+On+The+Run","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95e88d08f719bfac40dcd3ca8954748edba99a1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,232,141,8,247,25,191,172,64,220,211,202,137,84,116,142,219,169,154,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
