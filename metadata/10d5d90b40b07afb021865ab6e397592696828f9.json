Both earlier editions were landmark titles in science education as the first to make full and effective use of the history and philosophy of science in presenting for both the general and the science-oriented student an account of the content and nature of physical science.\nIn this third edition, each of the chapters has been reworked to further clarify the physics concepts and to incorporate recent physical advances and research. The book shows the unifying power of science by bringing in connections to chemistry, astronomy, and geoscience. In short, the aim of the new edition is to teach good physics while presenting physical science as a human adventure that has become a major force in our civilization.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface\nPART A - The Origins of Scientific Cosmology\nPART B - The Study of Motion\nPART C - Newton's Laws and His System of the World\nPART D - Structure and Method in Physical Science\nPART E - The Laws of Conservation\nPART F - Origins of the Atomic Theory in Physics and Chemistry\nPART G - Light and Electromagnetism\nPART H - The Atom and the Universe in Modern Physics\nAPPENDICES\nGeneral Bibliography 5 5 5\nCredits 559\nIndex 561","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d5d90b40b07afb021865ab6e397592696828f9","amp;dn":"Physics+-+The+Human+Adventure+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d5d90b40b07afb021865ab6e397592696828f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,213,217,11,64,176,122,251,2,24,101,171,110,57,117,146,105,104,40,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
