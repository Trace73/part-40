Physicians David K.C. Cooper and Robert P. Lanza examine this question and more in Xeno: The Promise of Transplanting Animal Organs Into Humans. They're on the cutting edge of this long-desired procedure, working for Harvard Medical School and Advanced Cell Technology, respectively, and look carefully at the scientific, ethical, legal, economic, and political issues appended to the promise of nearly unlimited organs and tissues for the needy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96fedc9fe70fb3be346e0707a9e00938e27662f1","amp;dn":"Xeno%3A+The+Promise+of+Transplanting+Animal+Organs+into+Humans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96fedc9fe70fb3be346e0707a9e00938e27662f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,254,220,159,231,15,179,190,52,110,7,7,169,224,9,56,226,118,98,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
