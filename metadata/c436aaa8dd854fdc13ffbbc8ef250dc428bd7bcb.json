No commercials. With original music.\n\nPreacher\n\nThe Rev. Little Ed Pembrook's Sunday morning religious show is creating problems with the religious community. It seems the Rev (a former wrestler) is selling all sorts of religious oriented merchandise. Even though everyone at WKRP is frightened of him, Andy &amp; Carlson finally get him to move his show to 6AM on Sundays, shorten it, and stop selling stuff. How'd they do it?
