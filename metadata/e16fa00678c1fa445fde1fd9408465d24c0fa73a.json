In its attempt to ensure that the cease-fire isn't breached, the Sri Lankan army's presence is felt everyday, conveying the strange sense of a country suspended in a state of being simultaneously without war and without peace.\n\nIn a far corner of this war-torn no-man's-land, serviceman Anura (Mahendra Perera) shares a small home with his wife LatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ (Nilupili Jayawardena) and his unmarried sister, SomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ (Kaushalya Fernando). Anura works by day as a guardsman, sharing his post and rifle with Piyasiri (Hemasiri Liyanage), an older man who takes the night shift. On one fateful day, when the army delivers early morning, life-altering orders to Anura, LatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡'s frustration will mount, and SomÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ will retrace the tragic consequences of Piyasiri's painful past, as told to her in the guise of a little girl's fairy tale.\n\nPoetic and haunting, this remarkable debut from director Vimukthi Jayasundara asserts a powerful new voice in filmmaking and stands as a breakthrough for Sri-Lankan cinema.\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: Terre abandonnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,033,799,680 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:45:30\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 576x320 (AR: 1.800)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1187 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.258 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 112 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n\nThanks cinephage for the rip\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
