The skills of the players were impressive, and they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compromise their jazz roots, with Jim PhilipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saxes and flute showing a decided John Coltrane influence. Chief arranger Mike McNaughtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s electric keyboard provided the most rock-oriented flavour. Daryl Runswick also creates some interesting passages with bowed bass. Covers of Ã¢â‚¬Å“MacArthur ParkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬Å“SomethingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dear PrudenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ seemed emblematic of a desire to cross over to rock listeners, though it should be noted that it was far less common for a jazz-rock band to interpret such material in 1970 than it would be in the years to come.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e218e19ff0506a9c4557facd964fbeed4339fc1","amp;dn":"Atlantic+Bridge+%281970%29+%5B24%2F96%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+LP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e218e19ff0506a9c4557facd964fbeed4339fc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,33,142,25,255,5,6,169,196,85,127,172,217,100,251,238,212,51,159,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
