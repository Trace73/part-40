More amazing still, he recorded the idea! This book chronicles the history of that idea, what many have come to call the Classic Bishop sacrifice, from its discovery and formative years through its remarkably complex uses in modern chess. During the past century, several annotators have attempted to explain the circumstances under which the sacrifice works, and when it doesn't. Edwards reviews their efforts and, in a spectacular ninth chapter, provides a modern classification. His taxonomy of the sacrifice is comprehensive and full of pleasant surprises for beginners and even accomplished masters. This book represents a thematic approach to chess tactics and strategy. Careful readers will suddenly discover that they are able, quickly and accurately, to see 5-10 moves or more ahead in these lines. Here you will find hundreds of carefully annotated games. Learn from brilliant moves and strategies; and take full advantage of others instructive mistakes.\n\nTable of Contents\nSigns &amp; Symbols 5\nForeword 7\nIntroduction 8\nPart I: History\nChapter 1 - The Life &amp; Times of Giaocchino Greco 13\nPart II: Theory\nChapter 2 - &quot;On Attacking the Castled King&quot; 26\nChapter 3 - The Art of Chess Combination 30\nChapter 4 - The Art of Attack 36\nChapter 5 - Contemporary Theory 49\nThe Kg8 line 50\nThe Kg6 line 56\nThe Kh6 line 72\nThe Bxg5 line 78\nThe Qh8 line 84\nThe Qxg5 line 88\nPart III: Practice\nChapter 6 - Games 94\nGreco's Sacrifice, the Early Years 94\nGreco's Sacrifice, through 1910 95\nGreco's Sacrifice, 1911-1935 126\nGreco's Sacrifice, 1936-1959 161\nGreco's Sacrifice, 1960-2010 200\nChapter 7 - Greco's Quiz 361\nChapter 8 - Related Literature 381\nBibliography 387\nIndex of Openings 390\nIndex of Asset Combinations 392\nIndex of Players 394","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec5725d39e092e8c2bbc6cc27e4a05f508e7bdad","amp;dn":"Sacking+the+Citadel+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec5725d39e092e8c2bbc6cc27e4a05f508e7bdad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,87,37,211,158,9,46,140,43,188,108,194,126,74,5,245,8,231,189,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
