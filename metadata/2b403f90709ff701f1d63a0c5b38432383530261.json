As one of the leaders of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, they had eight UK Top 40 albums in the 1980s including four UK Top 10 albums and two Top 5 albums. The band also had numerous singles in the UK Singles Chart and chart success all over Europe and Japan, as well as success in the US. During the 1980s Saxon established themselves as one of Europe's biggest metal acts. The band tours regularly and have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. They are considered as one of the classic metal acts and have influenced many bands such as Metallica, Motley Crue and Megadeth.\n\n    5 External links\n\nHistory\nFormation and early years (1976-1979)\n\nSaxon began as with a lineup formed by Peter &quot;Biff&quot; Byford on vocals, Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver on guitars, Steve &quot;Dobby&quot; Dawson on bass and drummer David Ward and were originally named &quot;Son of a Bitch&quot;. The band changed their name to Saxon shortly afterwards, replacing Ward with Pete Gill, and gained support slots on tour with more established bands such as MotÃƒÂ¶rhead. In 1979, the band signed to the UK record label Carrere run by Freddy Cannon and the first group signed to the UK label and released their eponymous debut album.\nSuccess in the UK (1980-1982)\n\nIn 1980, the band's follow-up album Wheels of Steel, was released and charted at #5 in the UK. It spawned two hit singles: the title track, and the crowd favorite &quot;747 (Strangers in the Night)&quot;. The album quickly provided the band with success and they began a series of long-lasting tours across the UK. On 16 August 1980 Saxon appeared at the first Monsters of Rock Festival where they received a very positive reception from the crowd. The band's set was recorded but was not officially released until 2000. On April 1980, Saxon made the first of many appearances on Top Of The Pops, where they performed the hit single &quot;Wheels of Steel&quot;.\n\nStrong Arm of the Law was released later in the year, charting at #11 in the UK. It is considered by many fans to be their best album, and it helped to keep the band's popularity increasing. Two singles were released from this album: the title track and Dallas 1PM, the latter written about the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Sold out tours of Europe and the UK followed as the album charted in several European countries. The band had also gained great success in Japan where the single Motorcycle Man had stayed in the charts for almost 6 months.\n\nBy 1981, the band had toured most of the world and found themselves with less time to record new material. But recording finally started at several European locations, and at the end of 1981 the band released their fourth album Denim And Leather which the band dedicated to their fan base. The album is still popular today and the title track &quot;Denim And Leather&quot; is regarded as a metal anthem. The album also featured many other fan favorites such as &quot;Princess of the Night&quot;, &quot;Never Surrender&quot; and &quot;The Bands Played On&quot; which were all UK Top 20 hits. Denim And Leather followed its predecessor's success and charted in several European countries and was certified gold in the UK. By this time the band was seen as the leaders of the NWOBHM movement with future greats Iron Maiden and Def Leppard following close behind.\n\nJust as the band was about to embark on a long tour to follow the success of Denim And Leather, drummer Pete Gill left the band after injuring his hand. The band had to quickly replace him with Nigel Glockler formerly of Toyah, who had to learn the entire set within a day and a half just before the tour was about to begin. Glockler is still with the band today.\n\nA series of headlining tours around the UK and a sold out tour in Europe with Ozzy Osbourne supporting, highlighted Saxon's immense touring ability and was set in stone with the classic live release The Eagle Has Landed (1982 UK no 5). Originally planned as a double live album, the record company decided to release it as a single live album despite protests from the band. The Eagle Has Landed is still a highly regarded live metal album. Saxon also played the 1982 Monsters Of Rock Festival again and became the first band to appear twice.\nPower &amp; the Glory and EMI years (1983-1987)\n\nAs the NWOBHM movement began to fade, 1983's Power &amp; the Glory, their highest selling album to date, saw Saxon establish themselves as a significant metal act in Europe along with Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. The &quot;Power and Glory Tour&quot; of 1983 was an arena tour that began in Europe, and was a huge success. The US leg of the tour with support act Accept proved to be successful and Saxon found themselves becoming a major act in the US as the album, in its first week of release, sold more than 15,000 copies in Los Angeles alone. The emerging glam metal scene in America would however prevent the band's conquest of the American market, as the genre was increasing in mainstream popularity. In late 1983 Saxon left Carrere.\n\nSaxon signed with EMI Records in 1984, with their first release on the label being Crusader, which charted at #18 in the UK. Though still heavy sounding like the band's past work, critics felt the album had a more commercial sound, and fans began to wonder what direction the band was taking. Despite its commercial sound, the title track became a fan favourite. The album sold over 2 million copies and the 1984 world tour &quot;The World Crusade&quot; was a success both in Europe and America. In the US they had MÃƒÂ¶tley CrÃƒÂ¼e and Krokus as support for many shows of the tour as the band spent one year on the road. By this time the band was considered as headliners for 1984Ã‚Â´s Monsters of Rock at Donnington, but scheduling issues and record label disputes kept the band from participating.\n\nThe band continued to take a more commercial direction. Innocence Is No Excuse released in 1985, created a division amongst fans as the band's once raw, heavy sound had been watered down to gain more attraction to the large US market. The album has, however, gained more appreciation both from fans and critics as time has passed since its initial release. A huge sold out world tour in support of the album followed, but tensions began to appear within the band and by early 1986, bassist Steve Dawson had left the band, and Saxon was forced to record their eighth studio album Rock the Nations without a replacement bassist. With Elton John making guest appearances as pianist on 2 tracks, and Byford recording the bass parts, the album charted higher than its predecessor and was considered a success. They hired bassist Paul Johnson to play for the band's European arena tour that followed. In the summer of 1986, Saxon headlined the Reading Festival and toured the United States.\n\nIn 1987 the band took time off from constant touring and recording that had begun in the mid 1970s, and only a minor tour of the U.S. and Canada was scheduled. In early 1987, Nigel Glockler left the band and was replaced by Nigel Durham.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b403f90709ff701f1d63a0c5b38432383530261","amp;dn":"Saxon+-+Sacrifice+++MP3++320k++++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b403f90709ff701f1d63a0c5b38432383530261","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,64,63,144,112,159,247,1,241,214,58,12,91,56,67,35,131,83,2,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
