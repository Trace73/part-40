They are not the most able tyrants, however, and have trouble holding any planet for more than a few days, if they can even manage to dominate it in the first place. In fact, they spend as much time running for their lives as they do enslaving and slaughtering innocents. Kaput and ZÃƒÂ¶sky are a dynamic, if generic, duo. ZÃƒÂ¶sky is a cunning, level-headed pseudo-intellectual who always has a plan. Kaput, on the other hand, is short-tempered and volatile; his strategies always involve &quot;crisperizing&quot; everything in sight. Kaput is a short and dumpy little terrorizer with a brilliant red mohawk, and ZÃƒÂ¶sky is a tall and thin tyrant with a set of yellow antennae. Their exploits almost always end in the same way for the two space tyrants; the two barely escape from their fates by flying off in their dumpy little spaceship, leaving a red smoke trail behind.\n\nThis is ripped from the 4 DVD's &amp; I have added some partial ep from my VHS tapes that I found in my collection.Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:295297ea05ecc31c69adecfd0c568b6ef5d99a48","amp;dn":"Kaput+%26amp%3B+Zosky+-+The+Ultimate+Obliterators+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"295297ea05ecc31c69adecfd0c568b6ef5d99a48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,82,151,234,5,236,195,28,105,173,236,253,12,86,139,110,245,217,154,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
