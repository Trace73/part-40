Benedict Groeschel - When Life Doesnâ€™t Make Sense (Suffering, Loss, and Betrayal) [audio presentation]\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered why bad things happen to good people? Trained psychologist Fr. Benedict Groeschel examines some of life's most difficult questions in the context of faith. He reveals penetrating insights and deeply personal reflections to find answers to the perpetually plaguing question &quot;Why?&quot;, and explains how in these painful moments, God manifests His loving Presence.\r\n\r\nThis CD contains the first two programs from the EWTN series &quot;What to do when life doesn't make sense?&quot; The first talk deals with the human condition and the ways in which we all suffer. Fr. Groeschel points us to the cross and the mystery that God himself, came down to earth, became a man, suffered, died and was buried. But He didn't leave us there. By death He conquered death and to those in the grave He granted life! God is about the business of turning our sufferings into resurrections.\r\n\r\nThe second talk deals with the loss or betrayal of friends. Again Fr. Groeschel points us to the betrayal and abandonment that Jesus experienced with His closest friends. Father encourages us with the knowledge that even when friends fail, God sends others into our lives to be with us in time of need. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy this presentation, please seed and support Lighthouse Catholic Media, NFP, which is a 501(c)(3) Not For Profit Company that seeks to answer the call for a New Evangelization.
