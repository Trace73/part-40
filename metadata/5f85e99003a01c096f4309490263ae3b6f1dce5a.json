Es el cuarto lanzamiento con Experience Hendrix Legacy Recordings, el cual contiene doce grabaciones inÃƒÂ©ditas que Hendrix estaba trabajando para el seguimiento previsto para Electric Ladyland. Fue lanzado en marzo de 2013.\n\nLas pistas que aparecen en People, Hell &amp; Angels son grabaciones inÃƒÂ©ditas de canciones que Jimi Hendrix y otros miembros de la banda (sobre todo de la alineaciÃƒÂ³n de la banda Band Of Gypsys con Billy Cox y Buddy Miles) estaban trabajando en el seguimiento de Electric Ladyland, tentativamente titulado First Rays of the New Rising Sun.[1] La mayorÃƒÂ­a de las grabaciones se han extraÃƒÂ­do de distintas sesiones entre 1968 y 1969, en los estudios Record Plant de Nueva York, y otras inclusiones en Hendrix's brief residencies en Sound Centre, The Hit Factory, y en su propio estudio, Electric Lady Studios\n\n\nPeople, Hell and Angels is a collection of quality studio tracks recorded (mostly) in 1968-1969 as the Experience was coming to an end and Jimi was renewing his friendships with Billy Cox and Buddy Miles, who appear here as sidemen on most of these tracks. The surprising thing about this set is not the sound quality (which is exceptional) or that these all sound like finished tracks, but the fact that even avid Hendrix bootleg collectors are unlikely to have heard most of this material.\n\nA great version of &quot;Earth Blues&quot; kicks things off with just Jimi, Billy, and Buddy (whose drums were replaced by Mitch Mitchell on the Rainbow Bridge/First Rays version). It's a more forceful take than the other version and also has some different lyrics. &quot;Somewhere&quot; is also a different take than the one used for Crash Landing and, of course, contains the original rhythm section and not the egregious overdubs of Crash Landing. &quot;Hear My Train A Comin'&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; are both taken from Jimi's first session with Billy and Buddy from May of 1969. In the film Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Hear My Train&quot; is played slow on a 12-string acoustic and sung so sadly that you can actually see a tear on Jimi's face as he sings. This version is not only electric and taken at a faster pace than normal, but it's an angry song, this time with a killer solo. &quot;Bleeding Heart&quot; is nice and raw and has a VERY different arrangement than he ever performed live. &quot;Let Me Move You&quot; was recorded with saxman Lonnie Youngblood, who released a couple singles with a pre-Experience Jimi Hendrix on guitar. It's nothing more than an old-school soul jam except the guitar is way more out front. It's a decent track, but doesn't really fit in with the sound of the rest of the album. &quot;Izabella&quot; and &quot;Easy Blues&quot; are rare studio recordings by the Woodstock band (Jimi, Billy, and Mitch Mitchell with Larry Lee on second guitar and Jerry Velez and Juma Sultan on percussion). This version of &quot;Izabella&quot; is now the earliest known recording of the song, while &quot;Easy Blues&quot; is actually a nice jazzy instrumental (previously released in edited form on Nine to the Universe).\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
