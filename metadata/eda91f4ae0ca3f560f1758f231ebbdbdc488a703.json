Make no mistakes: it's nothing like a masterpiece and it's no surprise that almost no one know about this movie, but here we got some of the constants in Marty's cinema: the street talking, the violence, the outsiders... Those things that &quot;mean streets&quot; dealt about... This was Martin Scorsese's debut and so it was for his friend Harvey Keytel who plays a chauvinist-bad tempered young man.\n\nSo, this is a movie that I recommend to those who really love Scorsese's work and wanna know about his origins.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063803/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063803/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda91f4ae0ca3f560f1758f231ebbdbdc488a703","amp;dn":"Who%5C%27s+that+knocking+on+my+door+%281967%29+-+Martin+Scorsese","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda91f4ae0ca3f560f1758f231ebbdbdc488a703","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,169,31,74,224,202,63,86,15,23,88,242,49,235,189,189,196,136,167,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
