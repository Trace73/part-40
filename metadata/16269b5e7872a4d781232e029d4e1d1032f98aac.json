One of those disciplines is texture painting and MODO has a robust set of texture tools to enable us to finish the look of our models right inside the application, making for a smooth, efficient, and flexible workflow. \n\nIn this MODO tutorial we'll use a simple creature model from the sculpting course to learn the basics of painting textures in MODO. We'll talk about setting up materials and working with basic channels. We'll learn to create new textures and use MODO's painting tools to create a custom look. We'll learn to use detail from photographs with Image Ink and learn to blend multiple texture layers together in the Shader Tree to get the effect we want. We'll also learn to add procedural layers for different effects and learn to bake all of our different texture maps down into single efficient images. \n\nThroughout the tutorial we'll cover some of the most common painting tools, brush tips and nozzle settings that will allow us to detail our creature very quickly. In the end, you'll have the knowledge you need to begin painting your own models in MODO.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16269b5e7872a4d781232e029d4e1d1032f98aac","amp;dn":"Getting+Started+with+Texturing+in+MODO+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16269b5e7872a4d781232e029d4e1d1032f98aac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,38,155,94,120,114,164,215,129,35,46,2,157,78,29,16,50,249,138,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
