Mainer's Mountaineers - Run Mountain (Arhoolie) [320KB] {MKOP}\n\nSomewhere near the crossroads of traditional string band music and early bluegrass, you'll find J.E. Mainer's Mountaineers. Though this recording was made in 1963, with Mainer having replaced all his former band members with his own children and a few friends, the collection is still nothing short of superb, with over 70 minutes of high spirited and rambunctious old timey music. Drawing on lively fiddle tunes, classic spirituals, ballads, and standard string band fare, a very loose and impromptu feeling runs through the 23 cuts, as the band seems to be having more than a little fun on tracks like &quot;If I Lose Let Me Lose&quot; and &quot;Crying Holy.&quot; Good harmonies, excellent musicianship and an authentic and sincere presentation make Run Mountain a nearly flawless document of traditional string band music.
