It even delivers a couplet that's doubled in profundity ever since Linkous put a bullet through his heart in a Knoxville alley: &quot;sometimes days go speeding past/sometimes this one seems like the last.&quot; \n\n&quot;Sad &amp; Beautiful World&quot; is found on the debut Sparklehorse LP, Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot. Though the album gained most of its attention, on its initial release, from buzzing, distorted, anthemic alt-rock numbers like &quot;Someday I Will Treat You Good&quot; and &quot;Hammering the Cramps,&quot; its longevity, its influence, and its cult following came about through those sad, sad songs where Linkous whispered in a cracked voice over sparse guitars and swimming radio static. \n\nOver the years, Linkous would refine his shadowy, atmospheric, mood-music craft, leading to collaborations with everyone from Tom Waits to Fennesz to Danger Mouse, and other classic cuts like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; (whose music video was, memorably, made by amazing Canadian filmmaking anachronist Guy Maddin). \n\nBut, nothing quite captured Linkous's abundant talents like his debut album; one that will continue to charm and inspire listeners long after he's gone. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad2e51c888117a295451d5d6517f8b05ba20b557","amp;dn":"Sparklehorse...Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot%281995%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad2e51c888117a295451d5d6517f8b05ba20b557","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,46,81,200,136,17,122,41,84,81,213,214,81,127,139,5,186,32,181,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
