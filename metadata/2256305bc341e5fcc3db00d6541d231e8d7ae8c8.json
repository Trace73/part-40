The second track consists of a woman \nsinging a somewhat more interesting line over an equally repetitious \naccompaniment played by what the notes identify as three guitars; but \nwhose most notable characteristic for European trained ears is their \nnon-Western standard tuning and tone color--rather restricted in upper \novertones (dull) by our standards. The third track is a nine minute solo \non a three holed flute; the construction of the piece results from the \nimmediate repetition several times in succession of very small \nfragments--4, 5, or 6 note fragments. Track 4 is a village chant/dance, \nwith drums, rattles and cowbells in a style that may well be familiar \nto anyone who has had a slight exposure to 'traditional African village music'. \nTrack 5 is rather similar in nature, but with lutes, and not the best \nrecording quality. Track 6 is a Christian Hymn sung by two schoolgirls. \nTrack 7 is a xylophone and chant track; track 8 more chanting with drums \nand cowbells, very repetitious; track 8 is women singing with a rattle. \nThere is a nice variety of instruments and styles; but not one track stands \nout as particularly fascinating. The collection demonstrates how different \nAfrican and European music and aesthetics are; jazz, blues, and the like \nnotwithstanding. \n\nQuality: 192Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2256305bc341e5fcc3db00d6541d231e8d7ae8c8","amp;dn":"AFRICA+-+Sierra+Leone+-+Musiques+Traditionelles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2256305bc341e5fcc3db00d6541d231e8d7ae8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,86,48,91,195,65,229,252,195,219,0,214,84,29,35,30,141,122,232,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
