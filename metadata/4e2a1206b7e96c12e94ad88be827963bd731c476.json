Writer Craig Kyle describes it as being the follow up to Messiah Complex and &quot;the middle chapter of what I think will be a major three-part saga, which will continue to define and redefine the X-Universe moving forward&quot;. (stolen from Wikipedia)\n\nCable has leapt into the timestream with the first baby born since M-Day, the hope of keeping the mutant race alive. The only problem is that the former X-Man Lucas Bishop decides that the baby is the first step towards the end of mutantkind and must be killed. After savagely beating Forge, he steals a cybernetic arm to replace his missing limb and every device, note, and scrap that Forge had collected on time travel and jumped into the timestream after Cable and the baby. This story follows Cable trying to raise a child in a less-than-utopian society while constantly having to look over his shoulder to protect her.\n\n\nListing and Order\n-----------------------------\n1.
