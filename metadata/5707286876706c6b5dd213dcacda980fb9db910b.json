The collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist painting made by Samuel Courtauld during the 1920s is one of the most important in existence. This book reproduces and discusses a representative selection of works from the Courtauld collection including Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergere, Renoir's La Loge, Seurat's Young wonan Powdering herself, Gauguin 's Nevermore and Te Rerioa, and an outstanding group of paintings by Cezanne; together they form a rich and varied view of avant-garde painting in France in the later nineteenth century. Each of the forty-eight paintings is shown in colour, together with a detailed assessment of its historical position, meaning and significance, technical make-up, and subsequent history. There are also three introductory essays . In the first, Dennis Farr provides an account of Courtauld's activities as a collector and patron of the arts. In the second, John House places the work of the Impressionist painters into its broader historical contexts, summarising and assessing recent debates in Impressionist scholarship","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5707286876706c6b5dd213dcacda980fb9db910b","amp;dn":"Impressionist+-+Post-Impressionist+Masterpieces+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5707286876706c6b5dd213dcacda980fb9db910b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,7,40,104,118,112,108,107,93,210,19,220,172,218,152,15,185,219,145,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
