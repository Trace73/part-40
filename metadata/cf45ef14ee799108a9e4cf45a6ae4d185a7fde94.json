It's not an unfair question, but at very \nleast Live at the Ryman captures him on a better than average night. There \nare no real surprises in the set list on Live at the Ryman, which seems to be \nthe way his audience wants it -- the crowd on this disc is loud and wildly \nenthusiastic, frequently singing along with Keen and chanting his name \nbetween songs as if he were some sort of conquering hero, and Keen and his \nband serve up the &quot;hits&quot; just the way the fans want 'em. Thankfully, Keen \nseems pretty jazzed by the crowd's enthusiasm (no wonder, since he was \ngetting such a warm welcome at Nashville's former home of the Grand Ol' \nOpry), and he and his band deliver these 14 songs with a large portion of \nenergy. Keen's road band is in solid form here (with the great Danny Barnes \nsitting in on banjo), and though Keen has sung these songs with more soul, \nhe's never short on fire and brings a showman's passion to the presentation. \nIf the song selection is a bit predictable, why wouldn't you want to hear Keen \nsing &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; &quot;I'm Comin' Home,&quot; &quot;Corpus Christi Bay,&quot; or even \n&quot;Merry Christmas from the Family&quot; on-stage? Live at the Ryman was \nobviously recorded for Robert Earl Keen's loyal fans, and they won't feel \nshortchanged by this disc, even if it covers ground he's covered several times \nbefore.\n\nThis live set at country music's historic epicenter captures singer-songwriter \nRobert Earl Keen at his most compelling, performing his rip-roaring yet often \nsentimental songs to an audience of adoring fans. Featuring favorites like the \nregretful &quot;What I Really Mean,&quot; the wild-and-wooly &quot;Gringo Honeymoon,&quot; and \nthe uproarious finale &quot;Farm Fresh Onions,&quot; Keen displays the good-humored \nvitality and innate musicianship that have made him one of country music's \nmost enduring below-the-radar talents\n\n&quot;Everything is played with lively precision by guitarist Rich Brotherton, bassist \nBill Whitbeck, drummer Tom Van Schaik and steel guitarist Marty Muse, with \nDanny Barnes guesting on banjo. It's hard to imagine a better show...&quot;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.
