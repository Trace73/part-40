Like naturally occurring diamond it is composed of a three-dimensional carbon crystal. Due to its extreme physical properties, synthetic diamond is used in many industrial applications, such as drill bits and scratch-proof coatings, and has the potential to be used in many new application areas","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ce4c6de6f2a70370203c834ebafccde24cee564","amp;dn":"CVD+Diamond+for+Electronic+Devices+and+Sensors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ce4c6de6f2a70370203c834ebafccde24cee564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,228,198,222,111,42,112,55,2,3,200,52,235,175,204,222,36,206,229,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
