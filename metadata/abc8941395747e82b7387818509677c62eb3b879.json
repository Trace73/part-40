Scott Campbell and Andy Hartnell. The comic features a group of busty, scantily-clad secret agents led by a mentor named Deuce. The comic is a spoof of James Bond-style spy/action stories, with the Danger Girls being a send-up of the Bond girls. Unlike the Bond girls, however, the Danger Girls are the stars of the series.\n\nThis original series follows the adventures of newcomer Abbey Chase as she joins the Danger Girls to face the evil neo-Axis group known as the Hammer. The plot includes endless double crosses and fast-paced battles against spectacular villains such as the mysterious Major Maxim.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc8941395747e82b7387818509677c62eb3b879","amp;dn":"Danger+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc8941395747e82b7387818509677c62eb3b879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,200,148,19,149,116,126,130,183,56,120,24,80,150,119,198,46,179,184,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
