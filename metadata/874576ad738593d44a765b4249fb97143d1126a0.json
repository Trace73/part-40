By ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œweb applicationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we mean an application that is accessed\nby using a web browser to communicate with a web server. We examine a wide\nvariety of different technologies, such as databases, file systems, and web services,\nbut only in the context in which these are employed by web applications.\n\nIf you want to learn how to run port scans, attack firewalls, or break into\nservers in other ways, we suggest you look elsewhere. But if you want to know\nhow to hack into a web application, steal sensitive data, and perform unauthorized\nactions, then this is the book for you. There is enough that is interesting\nand fun to say on that subject without straying into any other territory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874576ad738593d44a765b4249fb97143d1126a0","amp;dn":"The+Web+Application+Hacker%5C%27s+Handbook+-+Discovering+and+Explo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874576ad738593d44a765b4249fb97143d1126a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,69,118,173,115,133,147,212,74,118,91,66,73,251,151,20,61,17,38,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
