It is the result of many years of thinking and philosophical study about these topics. It differs from other philosophy of economics books as it also deals with economic reality (not only the science) and approaches its subject from an Aristotelian perspective. It differs from other Aristotelian studies about economics as it covers the whole of philosophy of the economy. This book argues why AristotleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s thinking guarantees an appropriate interdisciplinary synthesis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b600242afc8412c2f4d3447d85323d0e6d154b7","amp;dn":"Philosophy+of+the+Economy+-+An+Aristotelian+Approach+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b600242afc8412c2f4d3447d85323d0e6d154b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,96,2,66,175,200,65,44,47,77,52,71,216,83,35,208,230,209,84,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
