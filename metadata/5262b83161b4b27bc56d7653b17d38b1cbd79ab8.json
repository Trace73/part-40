A Floyd Dixon Celebration\n\nReleased shortly after jump blues legend Floyd Dixon's death at the age of 77, Time Brings About a Change features an all-star performance recorded near the end of the singer and pianist's life. Dixon was already in poor health by the time of this recording, and so he wisely minimizes his singing. (Longtime fans of this fluid and dynamic singer will find some of the broken and missed notes on songs like &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; as sad as Johnny Cash's equally frail performances on his last records.) However, Dixon's piano playing is surprisingly strong throughout, so much so that the band, featuring guitarist Kid Ramos and the Fabulous Thunderbirds' Kim Wilson on harmonica, never overshadows the star. The set list is heavy on Dixon favorites, throwing in Louis Jordan's &quot;Caledonia&quot; and Pinetop Perkins' &quot;Down in Mississippi&quot; for good measure. While not the best possible starting point for the Dixon novice -- the Ace label compilation Cow Town Blues still covers the high points most concisely -- Time Brings About a Change is a fine farewell to one of the last of the jump blues greats.
