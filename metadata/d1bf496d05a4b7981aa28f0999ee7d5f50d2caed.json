A British Petroleum executive (Michael Caine) is assigned to work with the British Army in North Africa handling port duties for incoming fuels. This gives him the official rank of Captain in the British Army. The Colonel (Nigel Green) in charge of the Dirty Dozen is told he must have a British officer accompany his men on a dangerous mission 400 miles behind the German lines and is saddled with the Petroleum executive, who tries to argue his way out by saying that his contract states he is to only work port duties. That argument is lost on the Brigade Commander (Harry Andrews) who simply points out that the executive is wearing a British uniform. The real leader of the Dirty Dozen (Nigel Davenport), a released prisoner himself, doesn't need or want the British officer, who's supposed to be in charge, but he's promised an extra 2,000 British Pounds if he gets him back alive. Disguised as Italians, their trek across Rommel's Africa includes ...\n\nA virtually unknown British masterpiece from the 60's. Its cynical and bleak portrayal of men in war is only matched by its lack of notoriety which is a shame considering how powerful the films message is. Admittedly Caine is a little wooden as the straight laced British Officer, but it is the much less known Nigel Davenport who steals the show as the hard bitten second in command. The films cynicism is the sum of it's ending which is suitably negative but still unsuspected. With all the flag waving war films out there its good to see the odd one which suggests the end never justifies the means.\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name:  Play Dirty.mp4 \n- Container:  MP4 - QuickTime \n- Size:  1.407 GB \n- Duration:  1h 53mn \n- Bitrate:  1 652 Kbps \n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \n- Bitrate:  Max.: Undefined / Average: 1 523 Kbps / Min.: Undefined \n- Frame rate (fps):  Max.: --- / Average: 25.000 / Min.: --- \n- Encoding profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;266b474f48666a150817&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n- Image size:  1024*432 \n- Pixel Aspect Ratio:  Undefined \n- Display Aspect Ratio:  2.40:1 \n- Interlacing:  Progressive \n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  AAC - MPEG-4 audio \n- Bitrate:  124 Kbps \n- Resolution:  Undefined \n- Rate:  48.0 KHz \n- Channel(s):  2 (stereo) \n- Position:  Front: L R\n\ntags: adventure, drama, war, Michael Caine, nazi, ww2, north africa","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1bf496d05a4b7981aa28f0999ee7d5f50d2caed","amp;dn":"Play+Dirty+1969+Michael+Caine+x264+AAC-miKem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1bf496d05a4b7981aa28f0999ee7d5f50d2caed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,191,73,109,5,164,183,152,26,162,143,9,153,238,125,95,80,210,202,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
