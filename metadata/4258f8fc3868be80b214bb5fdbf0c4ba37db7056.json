The torrent contains all files on the leopard-installation disk under Drivers/. the cool new things are in Apple/x64.\n\nIt is reported that the 64bit-drivers only work on vista 64bit and not on xp64. sadly there arent\\&amp;#039;t any apple support-documents or an official download on the apple-site. so i thought sharing these files would be a good idea.\n\ncheers\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4258f8fc3868be80b214bb5fdbf0c4ba37db7056","amp;dn":"Apple+BootCamp+2.0+Drivers+%28including+new+64bit-drivers%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4258f8fc3868be80b214bb5fdbf0c4ba37db7056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,88,248,252,56,104,190,128,178,20,187,95,219,240,196,186,55,219,112,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
