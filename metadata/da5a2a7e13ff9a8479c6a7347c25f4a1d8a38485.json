Burning bridges with family and friends,\n                Franky is in more trouble than ever before. But help\n                comes in unlikely forms, and out of the darkness a\n                new friendship is born.\n\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                          RiPPERS NOTES:                           \n                                                                      \n\n\n                Enjoy this great release from BiA\n\n                                                      \n                                       \n                                                \n                                        \n                                         \n                                                \n                                                                     \n                           GROUP NOTES:                            \n                                                                      \n\n                                   Greetz to \n\n                            FoV SFM TBS XiSO SAiNTS\n\n                            love your work boys ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da5a2a7e13ff9a8479c6a7347c25f4a1d8a38485","amp;dn":"Skins.S06E04.720p.HDTV.x264-BiA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da5a2a7e13ff9a8479c6a7347c25f4a1d8a38485","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,90,42,126,19,255,154,132,121,198,167,52,124,37,244,161,216,163,132,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
