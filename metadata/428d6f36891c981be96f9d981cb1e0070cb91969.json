The energy and fire in opening track &quot;Scalped&quot; alone means that the title could apply to just about any miserable hair-metal guitarist who thinks challenging Dale is a good idea. Unknown Territory also features a neat cameo -- none other than Huey Lewis provides the honking harmonica on two tracks. One of them, &quot;F Groove,&quot; is a duet between Lewis and Dale over a slow, funky beat -- listening to the two trade off is a delight. The titles and music of Dale's originals capture his vibe and Southern California's to a T. The rollicking &quot;Terra Dictyl&quot; and &quot;Maria Elena&quot; are more reasons why Dale is The Man, and who else but a surfer would write a song called &quot;Fish Taco&quot;? As always, Dale's choice of covers is idiosyncratic and successful, beginning with Boudelaux Bryant's &quot;Mexico.&quot; The drumming arrangement on this one is a dream, matching Dale's joyous guitar runs perfectly. Other covers include a kicking &quot;Ghostriders in the Sky,&quot; the album-closing &quot;Ring of Fire,&quot; and an only appropriate rip through the Rivieras' frat-rock classic &quot;California Sun,&quot; the latter two featuring Dale's only main vocals on the album. Perhaps the most jaw-dropping revamp is of the Jewish standard &quot;Hava Nagila&quot; -- given Dale's own Middle Eastern musical and family roots, the choice was inspired, and the job he does on it is perfection. Add in the eight-minute atmospheric strut of the title track and his cautionary environmental tale &quot;The Beast,&quot; and Dale does it again in spades.\n\n1\t\tScalped\tDale\t4:05\n2\t\tMexico\tBryant\t3:05\n3\t\tF Groove\tDale\t4:26\n4\t\tTerra Dicktyl\tDale\t3:11\n5\t\tTake It or Leave It\tDale\t4:27\n6\t\t(Ghost) Riders in the Sky\tJones\t3:16\n7\t\tFish Taco\tDale\t2:39\n8\t\tCalifornia Sun\tGlover, Levy\t3:16\n9\t\tMaria Elena\tDale\t4:19\n10\t\tHava Nagila\tTraditional\t4:00\n11\t\tThe Beast\tDale\t3:09\n12\t\tUnknown Territory\tDale\t7:55\n13\t\tRing of Fire\tCash, Kilgore\t3:31 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/unknown-territory-r205736/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/unknown-territory-r205736/review&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:428d6f36891c981be96f9d981cb1e0070cb91969","amp;dn":"Dick.Dale.-.Unknown.Territory.FLAC-Mighty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"428d6f36891c981be96f9d981cb1e0070cb91969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,141,111,54,137,28,152,27,233,111,157,152,28,177,224,7,12,185,25,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
