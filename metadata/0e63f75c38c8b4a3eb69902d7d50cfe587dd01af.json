The reason for the combo's success is obvious when listening to this CD, for the septet excels at a variety of tempos, grooves, and idioms within the New Orleans style. The opening &quot;When My Dreamboat Comes Home&quot; sounds like a New Orleans marching band, while some of the other songs swing more conventionally. Among the high points are &quot;Roses of Picardy,&quot; &quot;C'est Magnifique,&quot; &quot;I Love You,&quot; and &quot;Move the Body Over.&quot; The excellent musicianship, strong solos, and particularly the joyous group spirit make this a trad band well worth hearing.
