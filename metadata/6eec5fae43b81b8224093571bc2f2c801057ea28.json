Confirmed working on mac OS's  - 10.3x , 10.4.11, and 10.5.8\n\nUsing sound manager and various external firewire interfaces. \nSpark remains a robust software that was discontinued.\n\nThis package includes the key PATCH file made suitably to by TC electronic to adapt to 10.4.11 and does continue to work to 10.5.8 ! \nNever tried on 10.6x, and have a feeling it won't work? \nNever tried on INTEL . Only PPC machines.\n(I tried installing the program without the patch on 10.6.8 and the program runs fine - don't know why)\n\n\nComputers confirmed working with already mentioned software OS.\nPowerBook PISMO G3-400\nPowermac sawtooth G4-400\nPowermac DUAL 1ghz MDD\npowermac 9600 with Sonnet G4 upgrade\n\nI'm not sure if this works with OS9, if not, the earlier version works fine which is almost as robust. I have earlier versions I can seed if I get requests. \n\nThis does not come with anything but the original package. If you want 1000's of plug ins, there are other resources. BUT this comes with great plugins and in combo with the AU apple plugins, you can do many projects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6eec5fae43b81b8224093571bc2f2c801057ea28","amp;dn":"TC+ELECTRONIC+spark+XL+vst+2.8-2.82+-final+OSX+10.3-10.6.8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6eec5fae43b81b8224093571bc2f2c801057ea28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,236,95,174,67,184,27,130,36,9,53,113,188,47,44,128,16,87,234,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
