It\\\\\\'s too bad that\nmost other people don't share my views on him =.\n\n\nOne more note: apparently when using VLC (I have no idea if this occurs with other players), you have to go through the DVD top menu twice to play the concert. What I mean is; if you select Play from the first DVD Menu that shows up (or select a specific track), it will redirect to another DVD Menu exactly like the first. Here you can select Play (or choose a track) and it will actually play the concert. It would be much appreciated if someone could tell me why this happens (and if it's possible to fix it).\n\nAlso, my upload speed isn't terribly fast (caps at around 90KB/s or so I believe; my connection is only 3mb/s (375KB/s) down and 768kb/s (96KB/s) up) so bear with me and please help seed when you're done, ok? Share the wealth. I always seed my torrents to at least a 4.0 ratio (ones I didn't make myself, I mean). When I upload a torrent I try to seed as long as I can, or until the seed to peer ratio is healthier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d05668ebc2618aac96f5faa46469dd369175c34","amp;dn":"%282001%29+Journey+2001+DVD+%28NTSC%29+-+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d05668ebc2618aac96f5faa46469dd369175c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,5,102,142,188,38,24,170,201,111,95,170,70,70,157,211,105,23,92,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
