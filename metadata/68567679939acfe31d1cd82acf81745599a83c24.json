One of the projects, a collaboration with 13aDLucK produced by Catastrophe, turned out to be quite a strong set. After hearing the drafts Ripps sent, blocSonic was officially down for a release! What youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re about to listen to is a fantastic collection of raw, NYC style, boom-bap hip-hop. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s packed with smooth soul-drenched beats, classic B-Boy braggadocio and introspective rhymes. Luck &amp; RippsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vocal styles are both quite compatible, so their collaboration on this project feels natural and unforced. CatastropheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s production throughout serves as the perfect bed for their verses to rest. Once again, we feel that we, blocSonic, have dropped another solid contribution to the world of independent hip-hop. Check it outÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and rememberÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ share this with everyone you connect with. Thanks goes out to Luck, Ripps and Catastrophe for being part of the blocSonic fam. Thanks also to you for taking the time to download!\n\nPeace\n\nMike Gregoire\n\nFounder/Curator blocSonic.com\n\n\nThis audio is part of the collection: blocSonic\nIt also belongs to collection:\n\nArtist/Composer: Michael Gregoire\nDate: 2009-08-25\nKeywords: hip-hop; indepenent\n\nCreative Commons license: Attribution-Noncommercial-No Derivative Works 3.0\n\nIndividual Files\nWhole Item \tFormat\tSize\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003.pdf.zip \tZIP \t15.2 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_192Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t65.1 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_320Kbs_MP3.zip \tZIP \t84.9 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_Art_EPS_Format.zip \tZIP \t63.3 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_Art_PDF_Format.zip \tZIP \t6.6 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_Art_TIF_Format.zip \tZIP \t19.2 MB\n00-blocSonic_BSOG0003_FLAC.zip \tZIP \t186.6 MB\nBSOG0003_vbr.m3u \tVBR M3U \tStream\nBSOG0003_vbr_mp3.zip \tVBR ZIP \t31.1 MB\nAudio Files \tOgg Vorbis \t192Kbps MP3 \tVBR MP3\n01 - The Connection \t802.3 KB\n\t2.1 MB\n\t1.2 MB\n02 - Inhale \t1.6 MB\n\t3.8 MB\n\t2.2 MB\n03 - HalfLife \t1.7 MB\n\t3.8 MB\n\t2.4 MB\n04 - Complicity \t1.7 MB\n\t3.6 MB\n\t2.4 MB\n05 - Better Days \t1.9 MB\n\t4.3 MB\n\t2.6 MB\n06 - WUTIZUABOUT \t1.7 MB\n\t3.6 MB\n\t2.5 MB\n07 - Rock On \t1.4 MB\n\t3.1 MB\n\t2.2 MB\n08 - Feel Me \t800.9 KB\n\t2.1 MB\n\t1.1 MB\n09 - Roll Call \t1.4 MB\n\t3.0 MB\n\t2.1 MB\n10 - Light it Up \t2.0 MB\n\t4.2 MB\n\t2.8 MB\n11 - Felony Time \t1.5 MB\n\t3.5 MB\n\t1.9 MB\n12 - Nothin' Like Luck \t1.2 MB\n\t2.9 MB\n\t1.8 MB\n13 - Matty Ice \t860.5 KB\n\t2.3 MB\n\t1.2 MB\n14 - Never Be Another \t1.4 MB\n\t3.2 MB\n\t2.3 MB\n15 - Nothin' To Fuck With \t1.8 MB\n\t4.2 MB\n\t2.3 MB\nImage Files \tJPEG \tJPEG Thumb\nBSOG0003.jpg \t475.7 KB\n\t11.2 KB\nInformation \tFormat\tSize\nBSOG0003_files.xml \tMetadata \t[file]\nBSOG0003_meta.xml \tMetadata \t1.8 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68567679939acfe31d1cd82acf81745599a83c24","amp;dn":"%5BBSOG0003%5D+Luck+%26amp%3B+Ripps+-+The+Catastrophic+Connection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68567679939acfe31d1cd82acf81745599a83c24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,86,118,121,147,154,207,227,29,28,216,42,207,129,116,85,153,168,60,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
