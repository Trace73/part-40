Ram and Rahim were two different characters playing role of secret agents.\nIn most of the stories their job will be to save the world from a wicked scientist\nor an enemy of their nation. A typical story will feature their mission to bring back a stolen secret file from the villain's den, before it reaches the enemy nation.\nThe choice of character's name as Ram and Rahim was also contributing towards religious harmony among children. According to one volume namely Vatann ke Dushman Rahim is \nthe son of a Pakistani colonel who defected to India after he got disillusioned by fanaticism of Pakistani armed forces, especially an officer named Fanneh Khan. \nRam is the eldest son of a highly placed Indian Intelligence beaurecrat.\nRam is a Hindu name while Rahim is a Muslim name. Both will have tremendous friendship and both will work together to save the world.\nThey have a enemy named Dr. Fomanchu.\nIn later stories, Rahim loses his one hand and has to make do with a prosthetic arm that has the same capabilities as a normal hand, but much stronger and faster.\nChildren used to wait for summer holidays in the late 80s and early 90s for special editions of Ram-Rahim's and Crookbond's comics during summer holidays.\n\nCOMICS LIST:\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/89674466423949020516.jpg[/img]\n\n101 WONDER GIRL\n102 PAAILA\n103 MADAM INDIA\n104 HUNTERMAN\n105 SOUND KILLER\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/55558889284184698433.jpg[/img]\n\n106 VILLAIN\n107 CHILDREN FAUJ\n108 KAUN KARE KURBANI\n109 GOLI TERE NAAM KI\n110 BHARAT MATA KAHE PUKAR KE\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/10618864033168995683.jpg[/img]\n\n111 MAT SO JANA MERE LAAL\n112 WULFRAJ\n113 TIRANGA KA KAFAN\n114 LAL TERE ALBELE\n115 70 CRORE KA MURDA\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/41171657607895757030.jpg[/img]\n\n116 SAFED CHOOHA\n117 BETI AUR BAROOD\n118 KOHINOOR\n119 CHANAKYA KA BETA\n120 KHOONI DANAV KI WAPSI\n\n\nTHANKS TO THE ORIGINAL UPLOADER.\nPLEASE COMMENT IF YOU LIKE THEM.\nAND AFTER DOWNLOADING PLEASE SEED .\n\nWISH YOU ALL A VERY HAPPY AND SAFE DEEPAWALI.\n-SANJEET","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32fd4386841aa14c189c4ab13fe87f9b9d61c433","amp;dn":"+MANOJ+COMICS+%28HINDI%29+RAM-RAHIM+SET-06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32fd4386841aa14c189c4ab13fe87f9b9d61c433","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,253,67,134,132,26,161,76,24,156,74,177,63,232,127,155,157,97,196,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
