So as Dave Laredo, he made sure that even the cover photo was discreetly credited to &quot;Dad?&quot; Anyway, he was a really nice guy who wrote really cool, twisted, twangy cow-pop songs with a wistful pre-adolescent sense of awe and potential, then twisted them some more with a temperamental antique Roland synthesizer that had to be patiently warmed up but not too warm or it wouldn't play on-key. We had a dozen commercial FM stations playing &quot;Hurricane&quot; and the band was on tour headlining a Friday night in Chicago... when they had a disastrous quarrel and broke up. Adding insult to injury, Stiff Records had signed them and picked up the album but they needed us to spend a bunch more money remixing and remastering it... and then Stiff folded. (In a weird little bit of synchronicity, however, it turns out that Mike and Myke from Screaming Urge were playing in Cowboy Mouth when they cut the original demos).&quot;\n\nTrouser Press Review of this album: &quot;Onetime John Cale sideman Dave Laredo (here singing and playing guitar) leads this New York quartet whose borrowed name was subsequently adopted by a New Orleans band. The sincere and skillful power pop originals on Cowboys and Indians take most of their character from textured guitar figures as well as one-finger organ/synthesizer tootles; Suicide would seem to be an influence on both the songwriting and the keyboard work. Whether chosen to illustrate the song or inspired by the photo, the front cover snapshot of Laredo as a toothy eight-year-old is perfectly synched with &quot;Mr. Wilson,&quot; a cute song written from Dennis the Menace's perspective.&quot;\n\nTRACK LIST:\nA1 Hurricane\t\t\nA2 Long Hot Ride\t\t\nA3 Livin' Off The Land\t\t\nA4 My Brown Girl\t\t\nA5 Mr. Wilson\t\t\nB1 Indy Man\t\t\nB2 Too Young\t\t\nB3 Free Country\t\t\nB4 Son Of A Gun\t\t\nB5 Ki Yi Yea\n\nCREDITS:\nVocals, Guitar Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dave Laredo\nDrums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Julius Klepacz\nBass, Backing Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steve Cohen\nKeyboards, Backing Vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dodge\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f146807edb2c28033c112d2d065d15346e8b8ffe","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Mouth+-+Cowboys+And+Indians+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f146807edb2c28033c112d2d065d15346e8b8ffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,70,128,126,219,44,40,3,60,17,45,45,6,93,21,52,110,139,143,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
