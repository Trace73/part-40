I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday I seed the fourth out of 7 (9 albums, fixed 2 more) Depeche Mode albums I currently have as Flac. For the upcoming week there'll be one new Depeche album every day. So stay tuned =)\n\nNote that FLAC is NOT a lossy format such as Mp3s which might injur your HiFi equipment badly. FLAC is nothing but the best and without all the DRM enabled crap Apple and Microsoft push out these days.\n\nIf you don't know about FLAC or why it is the future, head over to http://flac.sf.net and get convinced yourself.\n_____________________\nDepeche Mode - Speak &amp;amp; Spell\n\n\nTracklist\n01.

While various synth pioneers had come before -- Gary Numan, early Human League, late-'70s Euro-disco, and above all Kraftwerk all had clear influence on Speak and Spell -- Depeche became the undisputed founder of straight-up synth-pop with the album's 11 songs, light, hooky, and danceable numbers about love, life, and clubs. For all the claims about &amp;quot;dated&amp;quot; '80s sounds from rock purists, it should be noted that the basic guitar/bass/drums lineup of rock is almost 25 years older than the catchy keyboard lines and electronic drums making the music here. That such a sound would eventually become ubiquitous during the Reagan years, spawning lots of crud along the way, means the band should no more be held to blame for that than Motown and the Beatles for inspiring lots of bad stuff in the '60s. Credit for the album's success has to go to main songwriter Vince Clarke, who would extend and arguably perfect the synth-pop formula with Yazoo and Erasure; the classic early singles &amp;quot;New Life,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Dreaming of Me,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Just Can't Get Enough,&amp;quot; along with numbers ranging from the slyly homoerotic &amp;quot;Pretty Boy&amp;quot; to the moody thumper &amp;quot;Photographic,&amp;quot; keep everything moving throughout. Gahan undersings about half the album, and Gore's two numbers lack the distinctiveness of his later work, but Speak and Spell remains an undiluted joy.\n\n\nExtraction Info\n\nExtracted: EAC\nUsed drive: Lite-on LTR-52327S   Adapter: 1  ID: 0\nRead mode: Secure with NO C2, accurate stream, disable cache\nRead offset correction: 6\nOverread into Lead-In and Lead-Out: Yes\n\nUsed output format: Internal WAV Routines\n                     44.100 Hz; 16 Bit; Stereo\n\nOther options:\n    Fill up missing offset samples with silence: No\n    Delete leading and trailing silent blocks: No\n    Native Win32 interface for Win NT &amp;amp; 2000\n\nConverted: Converted: flac - Command-line FLAC encoder/decoder version 1.1.0 Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002,2003  Josh Coalson\n\nLog, cue, playlist, FLAC fingerprint\n\n\n******************************************** \n\nPlease remember to upload as much as you download\n\n\n...::BE FAIR AND SHARE::... \n\n********************************************\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afcc7ca518448b385ca95a42f96cc886ac1d762e","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+Speak+And+Spell+%281981%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afcc7ca518448b385ca95a42f96cc886ac1d762e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,204,124,165,24,68,139,56,92,169,90,66,249,108,200,134,172,29,118,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
