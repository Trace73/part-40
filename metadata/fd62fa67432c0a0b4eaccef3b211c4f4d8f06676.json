Now everyone who works out can learn how to benefit from this superbly effective, time-efficient system.\nYour muscles will get bigger when you force them to do more work in the same period of time. That's the breathtakingly simple concept behind Charles Staley's innovative training system, EDT.\nOver 300 people participated in coach Staley's first-ever EDT Fat Loss Challenge, with spectacular results. This is because EDT is a program that adjusts to the individual. Here's how: EDT designates timeframes (called PR Zones) where as many repetitions as possible are completed. Every workout becomes more effective than the one that preceded it, making each session a personal record. More reps equal bigger muscles and improved health-a simple premise that delivers amazing results.\nIn this book Staley provides:\nÃ‚Â· Beginner, intermediate, and advanced programs for athletes interested in maximum performance at any level\nÃ‚Â· A 2-hour-per-week program for serious recreational bodybuilders\nÃ‚Â· Simple, effective ways to apply EDT to develop power, speed, and endurance\nÃ‚Â· Techniques that cut recovery time to train more intensely and frequently to reach goals faster","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd62fa67432c0a0b4eaccef3b211c4f4d8f06676","amp;dn":"Muscle+Logic%3A+Escalating+Density+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd62fa67432c0a0b4eaccef3b211c4f4d8f06676","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,98,250,103,67,44,10,11,78,172,206,243,178,17,196,244,216,240,102,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
