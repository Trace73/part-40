If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n\nIs this story set in future times or our distant past? One of Bigby and Snow's cubs recounts a misadventure between a certain Wolf Lord, a swindled sorcerer and a beautiful, green-skinned lady named Lake. Plus: Bufkin and Lily's adventures continue!\n\n\nThanks goes to theProletariat for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0ff39ab7e81ebddeccf6ce95d93f406e1445a7e","amp;dn":"Fables+123+%28c2c+%26amp%3B+noAds%29+%28theProletariat-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0ff39ab7e81ebddeccf6ce95d93f406e1445a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,255,57,171,126,129,235,221,236,207,108,233,93,147,244,6,225,68,90,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
