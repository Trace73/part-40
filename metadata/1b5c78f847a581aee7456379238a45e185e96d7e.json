The song was written by lead vocalist Matthew Bellamy, who has described the song as &quot;quite a personal song about me and my girlfriend.&quot; &quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot; is due to be released as the second single from the album on 16 November 2009, after &quot;Uprising&quot; in September.\n\n&quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot; was first performed live at the first of the 2009 A Seaside Rendezvous concerts at the band's childhood hometown of Teignmouth on 4 September. On 7 September, the song was played twice on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe as part of the MuseNight programming.\n\nSince the album's release, the song has had a mixed reception by critics, with some chastising the Rock sound while others thought of it as too much of a departure from their already diverse sound. Andrew Leahey of music website allmusic described the song as &quot;bizarre Timbaland-meets-Depeche Mode ambiance,&quot; using it as an example of the band's apparent &quot;tendency to pile excess upon excess.&quot;Reviewing for NME, Ben Patashnik noted &quot;Undisclosed&quot; as evidence of the band &quot;try[ing] to reignite the low-down R&amp;B of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Supermassive Black HoleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢,&quot; which he also suggests &quot;backfires.&quot;[10] Patashnik went on to criticize the song further, slating it as sounding like &quot;something Timbaland might find down the back of his mixing desk.&quot; Mojo, on the other hand, identified &quot;Undisclosed&quot; as one of the highlights of The Resistance, along with &quot;United States of Eurasia&quot; and &quot;Uprising&quot;.\n\n\nMusic video\nIn revealing news of the single's release, the band's official website confirmed that the video would be available to watch on MySpace from 3 November, and from the official site itself on 4 November. The video shows the band playing in a room full of cables, surrounded by screens. The screens display the song lyrics, as well as photographs of a heart. A brightly dressed dancer, wearing an outfit also made of ribbons and tassels, is also seen several times.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5c78f847a581aee7456379238a45e185e96d7e","amp;dn":"Muse+-+Undisclosed+Desires+%5BNew+Nov+2009%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5c78f847a581aee7456379238a45e185e96d7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,92,120,248,71,165,129,174,231,69,99,121,35,138,69,225,133,233,109,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
