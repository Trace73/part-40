His mother, Maria, dreaming of a more exciting life, saw no reason for her son to live his life as a Mexican just because he started out as one. The life of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Brando Skyhorse,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the American Indian son of an incarcerated political activist, was about to begin.\n\n\nThrough a series of letters to Paul Skyhorse Johnson, a stranger in prison for armed robbery, Maria reinvents herself and her young son as American Indians in the colorful Mexican-American neighborhood of Echo Park, California. There Brando and his mother live with his acerbic grandmother and a rotating cast of surrogate fathers. It will be over thirty years before Brando begins to untangle the truth of his own past, when a surprise discovery online leads him to his biological father at last.\n\nFrom an acclaimed, prize-winning novelist celebrated for his Ã¢â‚¬Å“indelible storytellingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (O, The Oprah Magazine), this extraordinary literary memoir captures a sonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s single-minded search for a father wherever he can find one, and is destined to become a classic.\n\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nBorn and raised in Echo Park, California, Brando Skyhorse is a graduate of Stanford University and the MFA Writers' Workshop program at UC Irvine.\n\nHis first book, The Madonnas of Echo Park, received the 2011 PEN/Hemingway award and the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His next book, Take This Man, is a memoir to be published in June 2014.\n\n\n\n\n(EPUB included)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775417-take-this-man&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775417-take-this-man&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n                           ------------------\n                          | Kindly seed back |\n                           ------------------\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc098035c82a6bc33a8c4ac6f312d3d7d486d203","amp;dn":"Brando+Skyhorse+-+Take+This+Man%3A+A+Memoir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc098035c82a6bc33a8c4ac6f312d3d7d486d203","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,9,128,53,200,42,107,195,58,140,74,198,243,18,211,215,212,134,210,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
