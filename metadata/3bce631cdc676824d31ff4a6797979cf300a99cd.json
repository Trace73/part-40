You hit play, slowly raise the \n volume, let the beats take over. Until suddenly..it HITS you! And you \n knowÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¯this is something that deserves to be kept exclusive. And so, \n the A&amp;RÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs of Armada Music decided to start a new series: Armada \n Exclusive Tracks &amp; Remixes. In this special pack, youÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºll find the \n hidden gems, the productions that have now been unlocked to do what \n theyÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºre made for: get under your skin, rock the dance floor and \n simply move you. \n\n Volume 2 of the series kicks off with the previously unheard Moar \n Levi Remix of Armin van BuurenÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹RainÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. ItÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs proggy, soothing and \n makes this Cathy Burton collab shine a new light. Romanian producer \n Adrian Ivan, also known as Mr. Pit, brings in another new moniker, \n Adiva. He hands in a mix of rousing big room prog and melodic, \n synth-driven breaks with Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹OxygenÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº, a tune with a special feel to it. \n Walsh &amp; McAuley present a tender, but energetic tune called \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹TransmissionÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº and Ukrainian producer talent Dart Rayne reveals an \n anthem that rides nothing but uplifting bliss, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Espada RoperaÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. Last \n but not least, DNS Project and Fast Distance go down the path of \n scintillating prog-trance with a track named Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹KickdownÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. \n\n But thereÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs much more! House master Sharam Jey sees a new remix of \n his track Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹The More That I DoÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. The Arkadia remix of this banger is \n an easy-going prog-house track with trancy influences. Finnish \n producer Sean Bayer gave one of tranceÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs biggest classics, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Solid \n Globe Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¾ North PoleÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº a 2011 update, with a contagious prog-trance \n swing. CapstarÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºs Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Do It EasyÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº was given a new 2011 treatment by \n Capstar himself! Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹Do It EasyÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº now rides a deep, electrifying sound \n thatÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âºll madden the clubbers. Eddie Bitar, who just released a new \n single on VANDIT, now presents a strong trancer with a mysterious \n sound to it, Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹DriftÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. Exit vs Kent &amp; Gian have the honour of giving \n the Exclusive pack a banging conclusion, with the techy trance \n Ãƒâ€žÃ‚Â¹PURAÃƒâ€žÃ‚Âº. \n\n And so here we are, presenting you 10 beautiful tracks and remixes. \n Brand new, unheard and ready to get into your skin! \n\n checkout:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/#release/armada-exclusive-tracks-and-remixe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beatport.com/#release/armada-exclusive-tracks-and-remixe&lt;/a&gt; \n s-volume-2/675404","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bce631cdc676824d31ff4a6797979cf300a99cd","amp;dn":"VA-Armada_Exclusive_Tracks_And_Remixes_Vol_2-%28ARDI2289%29-WEB-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bce631cdc676824d31ff4a6797979cf300a99cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,206,99,28,220,103,104,36,211,31,244,166,121,121,121,207,48,10,153,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
