Most of the composers represented enjoyed the highest patronage available to a fifteenth-century musician. The Englishman Robert Morton, whose rondeau Le souvenir de vous me tue is one of the most beguiling medieval songs, was a chaplain in the employ of Philip the Good and Charles the Bold, Dukes of Burgundy. (Charles was an accomplished composer in his own right, to judge by Ma dame, trop vous mesprenÃ©s). Gilles de Binche, called Binchois, was also one of Philipâ€™s chaplains, and the outstanding composer of the period, Guillaume Dufay, may also have had some connection with the Burgundian court; otherwise his patrons included the Malatesta family at Pesaro and later Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nFull notes, texts, and translations enclosed.
