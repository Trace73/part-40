The girls turn to the only person they have come to trust and know that she can't let their secrets out - Dr. Anne Sullivan. Finally being able to reveal the torment that &quot;A&quot; has put them through to someone outside of the tight-knit group gives the girls a sense of relief and Emily a new sense of courage. But with the cat being out of the bag, has a weight really been lifted off their shoulders, or could it possibly have just provoked a beast? And now that Dr. Sullivan is aware of &quot;A&quot; and what the girls have been put through, could she be next on &quot;A's&quot; target list? Meanwhile, Hanna's grandmother comes to town to stir up trouble for Tom's rehearsal dinner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23a6d1029ac3c6105c9002cc8fc586099cbdd2da","amp;dn":"pretty.little.liars.s02e11.i.must.confess.hdtv.xvid-2hd.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23a6d1029ac3c6105c9002cc8fc586099cbdd2da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,166,209,2,154,195,198,16,92,144,2,204,143,197,134,9,156,189,210,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
