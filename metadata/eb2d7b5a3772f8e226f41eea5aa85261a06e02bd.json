He is considered to be one of the pioneers and\nfounders of soul music.\n\nCooke had 29 Top 40 hits in the U.S. between 1957 and 1965. Major hits like &quot;You Send Me&quot;,\n&quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;, &quot;Chain Gang&quot;, &quot;Wonderful World&quot; and &quot;Bring It on Home to Me&quot;\nare some of his most popular songs. Cooke was also among the first modern black\nperformers and composers to attend to the business side of his musical career. He founded\nboth a record label and a publishing company as an extension of his careers as a singer and\ncomposer.\n\nSam Cooke was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi. He added an &quot;e&quot; onto the end of his name,\nthough the reason for this is disputed. He was one of seven children of Annie Mae and the\nReverend Charles Cook, a Baptist minister. The family moved to Chicago in 1933.\n\nHis first pop single, &quot;Lovable&quot; (1956), was released under the alias of &quot;Dale Cooke&quot; in order\nto not alienate his gospel fan base (he sang with The Soul Stirrers until 1957) ; there was a\nconsiderable taboo against gospel singers performing secular music. However, the alias\nfailed to hide Cooke's unique and distinctive vocals. No one was fooled. Art Rupe, head of\nSpecialty Records, the label of The Soul Stirrers, gave his blessing for Cooke to record\nsecular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and\nproducer Bumps Blackwell were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar\nto that of another Specialty Records artist, Little Richard. When Rupe walked in on a\nrecording session and heard Cooke covering Gershwin, he was quite upset. After an\nargument between Rupe and Blackwell, Cooke and Blackwell left the label.\n\n\n Disc 1\n\n  01. You Send Me\n  02. The Lonesome Road\n  03. Tammy\n  04. Ol' Man River\n  05.
