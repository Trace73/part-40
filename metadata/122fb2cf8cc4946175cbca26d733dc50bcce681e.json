This wacky, weirdly enthralling exploration of the first three presidential assassinations. Vowell (The Partly Cloudy Patriot), a contributor to NPRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s This American Life and the voice of teenage superhero Violet Parr in The Incredibles, takes readers on a pilgrimage of sorts to the sites and monuments that pay homage to Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley, visiting everything from grave sites and simple plaques (like the one in Buffalo that marks the place where McKinley was shot) to places like the National Museum of Health and Medicine, where fragments of LincolnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s skull are on display. An expert tour guide, Vowell brings into sharp focus not only the figures involved in the assassinations, but the social and political circumstances that led to each-and she does so in the witty, sometimes irreverent manner that her fans have come to expect. Thus, readers learn not only about how Garfield found himself caught between the Stalwarts and the Half-Breeds, bitterly divided factions of the Republican party, but how his assassin, Charles Guiteau, a supporter of the Stalwarts and an occasional member of the Oneida Community, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwas the one guy in a free love commune who could not get laid.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Vowell also draws frequent connections between past events and the present, noting similarities between McKinleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preemptive war against Cuba and the Philippines and the current war in Iraq. This is history at its most morbid and most fascinating and, fortunately, one neednÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t share VowellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s interest in the macabre to thoroughly enjoy this unusual tour.\n\nAbridged.\nMp3s. 64 kbps.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.com\n\n-------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:122fb2cf8cc4946175cbca26d733dc50bcce681e","amp;dn":"Assassination+Vacation+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Sarah+Vowell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"122fb2cf8cc4946175cbca26d733dc50bcce681e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,47,178,207,140,196,148,97,117,203,202,38,215,51,220,80,188,206,104,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
