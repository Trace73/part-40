If you step into a dimly lit room, Lux will automatically lower the brightness of your display to make it not only comfortable to read, but to also preserve battery power.\n\nLux is also able to adjust the screen temperature of your display automatically to make it appropriate for night usage. At sunset, you can have Lux automatically warm your display and switch to your Night profile. If you're an astronomer, you can enable astronomer mode to cut out harsh white light. If you have a root enabled phone, you may even be able to apply these enhancements at a low level with Lux's plug-in system.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Lux is that you can teach it how to behave. If the backlight is too bright or dim for your liking, simply open the provided Dashboard, adjust the brightness slider to the level you desire, then hold the link button. Lux will use this new 'link' as a reference in future.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Stable, custom auto brightness with root plug-in support.\n- Use your ambient light sensor or camera(s) to read in ambient light.\n- Subzero brightness for night viewing.\n- Select between Auto, Day, Night, Car and Cinema light profiles\n- Automatic night mode.
