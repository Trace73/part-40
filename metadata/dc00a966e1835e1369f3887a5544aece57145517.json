A Northern lad who climbed out of the slums thanks to an uncommonly brilliant mind, he was always the underdog, but his bark was funnier and more incisive than many comics who claimed to bite. \n\nMarried twice in real life, he had a third wife in his comic worlda fictional ogre built from spare parts left by fleeing Nazis at the end of World War IIand an equally frightening mother-in-law. He was down to earth, yet given to eloquent, absurd flights of fancy. He was endlessly generous with his time, but slow to buy a round of drinks. He was a mass of contradictions. In short, he was human, he was genuine, and that's why audiences loved him. This is his story.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Biography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc00a966e1835e1369f3887a5544aece57145517","amp;dn":"The+Trials+and+Triumphs+of+Les+Dawson+by+Louis+Barfe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc00a966e1835e1369f3887a5544aece57145517","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,0,169,102,225,131,94,19,105,243,136,122,85,68,174,206,87,20,85,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
