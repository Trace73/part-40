With cinema as his main source of solace, he haunts the local movie-house. All the while, his family looms large in our peripheral vision as do the menacing bullies of his school, but Bud is the center of attention both from the camera's angle and from his doting family. With a gray background, the film fuses clips and audio from classic movies into Bud's dreary childhood and brings it to life with an elegance Bach would bring to your home movies. The overall effect is a montage of memory which seems to ignite flashes of recognition in the viewer.              \n\nACTORS: \nMarjorie Yates, Leigh McCormack, Anthony Watson, Nicholas Lamont, Ayse Owens, Tina Malone, \n\nRELEASED: \n 28 May 1993 \n\nIMDB: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104753/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104753/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n Size: 4693886439 bytes (4.37 GiB), duration: 01:25:33, avg.bitrate: 7316 kb/s\nAudio: ac3, 48000 Hz, stereo (eng)\nVideo: h264, yuv420p, 1280x688, 23.98 fps(r) (eng)\nSubtitles: eng \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=44058553253518533680.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=44058553253518533680.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=39618769740941121392.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=39618769740941121392.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=61815195016286465018.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgili.com/viewer.php?file=61815195016286465018.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD AND ENJOY. \n\n KEEP IT FOR LONG SEEDING TO HELP OTHERS \n\n \n Thanks to : SiNNERS\n Movie Share ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbb4493e5c66df22b26e1fd8366432471ed7166b","amp;dn":"The+Long+Day+Closes+1992+720p+BluRay+x264-SiNNERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbb4493e5c66df22b26e1fd8366432471ed7166b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,180,73,62,92,102,223,34,178,110,31,216,54,100,50,71,30,215,22,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
