The rest either die or live a miserable life. In this grim reality, gangs and crime organizations rose to power and now rule the different districts of the country while men of the law sit around and barely do anything about it. Six individuals go on separate quests in this harsh land. Each one has a different goal or agenda. Each one has different wishes and desires. But the only way for them to see their goals is through blood and tears. Haunting Scars is the first volume in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Crown the VillainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ series","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5772c543a2fac03a6bd3b94b2714c669cf213e2e","amp;dn":"Crown+The+Villain+%28Volume+1%29+Haunting+Scars+By+D.Sharon%5BPDF%5D+DTW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5772c543a2fac03a6bd3b94b2714c669cf213e2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,114,197,67,162,250,192,58,107,211,185,75,39,20,198,105,207,33,62,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
