It is far superior to the others I found available at the &quot;usual places&quot; - here is why:\n\nFirst I downloaded the current release of the DriverPacks.net Mass Storage Driver Pack v9.01 and their slipstreaming tool DP_BASE v8.12.5.\nI then copied my Windows Server 2003 R2 CD to my computer and slipstreamed in all the SCSI/RAID/SATA drivers.\nAfter that I loaded up the TSRh Team's release of &quot;Passware Kit Enterprise&quot; to create a &quot;WindowsKey.iso&quot; using the slipstreamed 2003 Server R2.\n\nThe result is a Password reset disk that will work on Workstation OSes: Win7/Vista/XP and Server OSes: 2008/2003/2000/NT4 for local and domain user accounts on Fat/Fat32/NTFS partitions on almost ANY Mass Storage Device!\n\nThis iso has support for all standard Mass Storage supported by Windows and has almost 700 ADDITIONAL SCSI/RAID/SATA Drivers to ensure this disk will work on 99.9% of the systems you try to use it on including the most robust enterprise grade servers!\n\nAll credit for the cracked version of Passware's software itself goes to TSRh Team.\nAll credit for the consolidation of all of the drivers goes to DriverPacks.net and their people.\nI only take credit for coming up with the idea to put the two together and actually make it happen. :-)\n\n\nNO I.T. PERSON SHOULD BE WITHOUT THIS!!!\n\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nHOW TO USE\n----------------------------------------------------\nFirst burn the ISO file to a CD (I recommend you do it at the slowest speed you can).\nNext, just put the CD in a Laptop/Workstation/Server you need to reset a password on and boot up from the CD.\nOnscreen instructions will wall you through everything.\n\n\nNOTE: If you boot to this disc and cannot see your windows partition you may have a mass storage device in the 0.1% that is not covered by this disc. If this is the case you can press &quot;F6&quot; during the blue eindows setup screen to load your own 3rd party SCSI/RAID driver.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71322af28ca7dbc91d081f8a1618c5bbae05a29a","amp;dn":"Passware+Windows+Key+Enterprise+9.3+build+815+with+over+700+driv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71322af28ca7dbc91d081f8a1618c5bbae05a29a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,50,42,242,140,167,219,201,29,8,31,138,22,24,197,187,174,5,162,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
