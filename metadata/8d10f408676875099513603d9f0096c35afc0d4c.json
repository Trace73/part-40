In the \n1950s as a youngster he was travelling the gospel highway \nwith the Womack Brothers. By the 1960s, he was being mentored \nby Sam Cooke who schooled him in the ways of R&amp;B, while \nJames Brown also drilled him into shape. Soon, the Rolling \nStones and Wilson Pickett were queuing up to record his songs.\n\nIn the early 1970s, not long after Janis Joplin covered one \nof his compositions, Bobby was with her just hours before \nshe died. He played rhythm guitar on Sly &amp; the Family Stone's \nFamily Affair before becoming a major soul star in his own \nright with hits like Across 110th Street, Woman's Gotta Have \nIt and Harry Hippie.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/z7Hxn.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/z7Hxn.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/mYDwx.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/mYDwx.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/iEUR.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.suxorz.com/images/2013/07/20/iEUR.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFORMAT.......................: MP4\nCODEC........................: X264\nGENRE........................: Music video / Documentary\nFILE SIZE....................: 273 MiB\nRESOLUTION...................: 720*406\nFRAME RATE...................: 25.000 fps\nAUDIO AAC ...................: 128 Kbps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English\nSUBTITLES....................: NONE\nRUNTIME......................: 59mn 20s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d10f408676875099513603d9f0096c35afc0d4c","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Bobby+Womack+Across+110th+Street+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d10f408676875099513603d9f0096c35afc0d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,16,244,8,103,104,117,9,149,19,96,61,159,0,150,195,90,252,13,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
