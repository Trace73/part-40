So if you're in the &quot;funk&quot; section, you'll start by learning the funk chords he's using as a bare minimal (even beginners can benefit from this part).\n\nThen we proceed to break down 5 unique riffs, runs, licks, or tricks you can play over these same chords. In fact, the underlying chords and patterns hardly change. But you learn dozens of ways to approach improvising over them. We do this for funk, r&amp;b (soul), gospel (shouting music), and jazz.\n\nBy the end, you'll have 20 professional, advanced soloing licks you can pull out the cupboard at any time.\n\n(Warning: These are riffs, licks, tricks, and secrets most people wouldn't be able to pick out on their own because the notes move so fast. But we break every thing down to &quot;turtle speed&quot; with close-ups and special camera angles, repeating every note multiple times and showing diagrams and illustrations on the screen. It's practically impossible to miss anything).
