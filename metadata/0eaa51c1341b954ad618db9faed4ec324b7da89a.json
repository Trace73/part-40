There is a young man in the British army infantry who had been considering emigrating until the war offered him its ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgrand promise of changeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and a middle-aged French civil servant, a socialist and writer whose ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfaith simply crumbledÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the outbreak of war. There is a twelve-year-old German girl thrilled with the news of the armyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s victories because it means that she and her classmates are allowed to shout and scream at school. There is an American woman married to a Polish aristocrat, living a life of quiet luxury when the war begins but who will be moved, ultimately, to declare: Looking Death in the eyes, one loses the fear of Him. From field surgeon to nurse to fighter pilot, some are on the Western Front, others in the Balkans, East Africa, Mesopotamia. Two will die, one will never hear a shot fired; some will become prisoners of war, others will be celebrated as heroes. But despite their various war-time occupations and fates, genders and nationalities, they will be united by their involvementÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½witting or otherwiseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½in The Great, and terrible, War.\n\nA brilliant mosaic of perspectives that moves between the home front and the front lines, The Beauty and the Sorrow reconstructs the feelings, impressions, experiences, and shifting spirits of these twenty particular people, allowing them to speak not only for themselves but also for all those who were in some way shaped by the war, but whose voices have been forgotten, rejected, or simply remained unheard.\n\nPeter Englund is a Swedish historian, who has received numerous prizes in his own country and whose works have been translated into fifteen languages. He has also been working as a war correspondent in the Balkans, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Englund is a member of the Swedish Academy (which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature) and in 2008 was appointed its new permanent secretary, an office he still holds.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0eaa51c1341b954ad618db9faed4ec324b7da89a","amp;dn":"An+Intimate+History+of+the+First+World+War+-+Peter+Englund+%5Bepub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0eaa51c1341b954ad618db9faed4ec324b7da89a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,170,81,193,52,27,149,74,214,24,219,159,174,212,236,50,75,125,168,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
