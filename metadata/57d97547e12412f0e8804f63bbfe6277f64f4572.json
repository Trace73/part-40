Although many of these holidays have assumed a secular attitude, the original, supernatural tone of these days still colors the celebrations. Halloween, or All Hallow's Eve as it was once known, has become a day for children to don costumes, trick-or-treat for candy, and play pranks. Outside the United States, however, people in many countries still set aside a day to honor and pray for the deceased. &quot;Halloween and Commemorations of the Dead&quot; looks at the different customs from around the world, including Halloween, All Souls' Day, Day of the Dead, Tomb Sweeping Day and the Ghost Festival.\n\nAbout the Author\nRoseanne Montillo earned her undergraduate and graduate degrees from Emerson College in Boston.
