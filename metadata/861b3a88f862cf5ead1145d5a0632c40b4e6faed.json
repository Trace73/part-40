Two weeks later, RCA recorded the original cast in performance of the one-act opera, with Rosemary Kulhmann as the mother and Chet Allen as the crippled Amahl. Menotti protege Thomas Shippers conducted the performance with producers John Pfeiffer and Richard Mohr supervising the recording. Though the 1950s, Amahl was broadcast every Christmas, first in live productions and later on tape. Televised presentations stopped after that, though the opera is now presented annually by many professional and amateur companies.
