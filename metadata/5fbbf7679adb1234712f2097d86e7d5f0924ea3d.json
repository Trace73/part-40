Rex Foster began performing in 1963 and writing songs in 1965. One hears Dylan's influence, along with Ray Charles, Joan Baez, Buffy St. Marie, The Beatles, The Byrds, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Big Daddy Tom Donahue and falling in love with Joan's sister, Mimi Farina. Rex's first band Rachael's Children rocked Texas in 1966, before anyone in San Francisco knew what &quot;psychedelic&quot; meant. He came to California, worked with Curt Boettcher, and toured with Medicine Ball Caravan across the United States and Europe with the likes of Van Morrison, Joni Mitchell, B.B. King, Hot Tuna, and Rod Stewart and Faces. Rex was an important part of the progressive country uprising during the 1970s, and toured with Merle Haggard in 1976. The cult classic Roads Of Tomorrow album appeared on the famous Barclay Records label in France (only) in 1970. This 600 count limited edition is housed in a miniature replica paper gatefold sleeve reissue and features two bonus tracks. Insert includes lyrics, the original 1970 liner notes and an interview with Rex Foster himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fbbf7679adb1234712f2097d86e7d5f0924ea3d","amp;dn":"Rex+Foster+-+Roads+Of+Tomorrow+%5B1970%5D+-+Remasted+Limited+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fbbf7679adb1234712f2097d86e7d5f0924ea3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,187,247,103,154,219,18,52,113,47,32,151,216,110,125,95,9,36,234,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
