Some consider this detrimental to the sound quality when reproduced on high-quality equipment. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab releases are highly desirable due to their attention to detail concerning the audio mastering process. Some of the techniques used are half-speed mastering and pressing gold-plated CDs. MFSL also releases record albums meant to be played at 45 RPM instead of the standard 33? RPM, for better sound quality. These albums must be released on two or three discs, as less music can be held at increased speed.\n\nMFSL only acquires the license to reproduce releases for a specific time period, and because of the limited quantities produced, they are highly sought after.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:024ee5528a1f8a71c030e6f27a6facf2e56574db","amp;dn":"The+Velvet+Underground+-+The+Velvet+underground+%26+Nico+%28MFSL%29+%28F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"024ee5528a1f8a71c030e6f27a6facf2e56574db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,78,229,82,138,31,138,113,192,48,230,242,122,111,172,242,229,101,116,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
