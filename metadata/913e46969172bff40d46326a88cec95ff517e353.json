What linguist Meg Dupris and her crewmates aboard the Earth ship Damocles discover on DidetÃ¢â‚¬â€a planet bathed in the near-eternal daylight of seven sunsÃ¢â‚¬â€is a humanoid race with a different language, a different look, and a surprisingly similar society.\n\nBut here, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Ã¢â‚¬Å“EarthersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who are the extraterrestrial invaders, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to MegÃ¢â‚¬â€a woman haunted by tragedy and obsessed with the power of communicationÃ¢â‚¬â€to find the key to establishing trust between the natives and the newcomers. In Loul Pell, a young Dideto male thrust into the forefront of the historic event, Meg finds an unexpected kindred spirit, and undertakes an extraordinary journey of discovery, friendship, and life-altering knowledge.\n\nTold from both sides of a monumental encounter, Damocles is a compelling novel about manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first contact with an extraterrestrial race.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:913e46969172bff40d46326a88cec95ff517e353","amp;dn":"Damocles+-+S.+G.+Redling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"913e46969172bff40d46326a88cec95ff517e353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,62,70,150,145,114,191,244,13,70,50,106,136,206,201,95,245,23,227,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
