From Superman and Batman to the Fantastic Four and the X-Men, these pop-culture juggernauts, with their &quot;powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men,&quot; thrilled readers and audiencesÃ¢â‚¬â€and simultaneously embodied a host of our dreams and fears about modern life and the onrushing future.\n\nBut that's just scratching the surface, says Jeffrey Kripal. In Mutants and Mystics, Kripal offers a brilliantly insightful account of how comic book heroes have helped their creators and fans alike explore and express a wealth of paranormal experiences ignored by mainstream science. Delving deeply into the work of major figures in the fieldÃ¢â‚¬â€from Jack KirbyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cosmic superhero sagas and Philip K. DickÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s futuristic head-trips to Alan MooreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sex magic and Whitley StrieberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communion with visitorsÃ¢â‚¬â€Kripal shows how creators turned to science fiction to convey the reality of the inexplicable and the paranormal they experienced in their lives. Expanded consciousness found its language in the metaphors of sci-fiÃ¢â‚¬â€incredible powers, unprecedented mutations, time-loops and vast intergalactic intelligencesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the deeper influences of mythology and religion that these in turn drew from; the wildly creative work that followed caught the imaginations of millions. Moving deftly from Cold War science and Fredric Wertham's anticomics crusade to gnostic revelation and alien abduction, Kripal spins out a hidden history of American culture, rich with mythical themes and shot through with an awareness that there are other realities far beyond our everyday understanding.\n\nA bravura performance, beautifully illustrated in full color throughout and brimming over with incredible personal stories, Mutants and Mystics is that rarest of things: a book that is guaranteed to broadenÃ¢â‚¬â€and maybe even blowÃ¢â‚¬â€your mind.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73676f4773f70260c4838967d066fa33d22ff7b3","amp;dn":"Mutants+and+Mystics+-+Science+Fiction%2C+Superhero+Comics%2C+and+the","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73676f4773f70260c4838967d066fa33d22ff7b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,103,111,71,115,247,2,96,196,131,137,103,208,102,250,51,210,47,247,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
