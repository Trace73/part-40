It's based on the Language and Behaviour (LAB) Profile developed by Rodger Bailey - a simplification of the original 60 (!) meta-programs down to 14, along with the questions you can use to elicit them.\n\nThis is a kind of psychometric test, although as people may have different meta-programs in different contexts, and they may change over time, it's not about pigeonholing people. Shelle also tells you the kind of language to use to reach particular kinds of people - useful in sales, negotiation, motivation and deciding who to hire for a particular job. The book is chatty with a good sense of humour...............\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfce64b0e8870039d10b28b0cd592df776bd19b6","amp;dn":"Words+That+Change+Minds%3A+Mastering+the+Language+of+Influence-MAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfce64b0e8870039d10b28b0cd592df776bd19b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,206,100,176,232,135,0,57,209,11,40,176,205,89,45,247,118,189,25,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
