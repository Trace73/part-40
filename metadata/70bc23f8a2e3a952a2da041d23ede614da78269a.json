Though sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d fallen in love with him, she was strong enough to say goodbye. We saw the softer side of Rafe, especially toward the end, but it was too lateÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nOr was it?\n\nSeduced begins almost two years after Ari starts her new life. She is teaching at a community college, and when she asks the class whether they have any questions for her, Rafe is there and has only one: Will you go on a date with me?\n\nWhat is AriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answer? YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find out in the third installment of Melody AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New York Times best-selling series, Surrender.\n\nAlong with AriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, we will see what happens when Shane and Lia become trapped together on an island when a tropical storm hits, and how the sparks will fly again.\n\nAnd we canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget about Rachel Palazzo, who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking for love, but finds it in a shocking way.\n\nThis story continues the lives of Ari, Lia and Rachel. These three women are resilient, determined, and worth loving.
