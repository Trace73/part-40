Wright's New Testament for Everyone series; other volumes in the series can be found by clicking on my username. The whole series will be completed and posted here within the next two weeks.\n\nShort commentary on Paul's letter to the Romans by the great New Testament scholar.\n\nWriting in an approachable and anecdotal style, Tom Wright helps us see the great sweep of this letter. Romans has long been viewed as the book above all in which Paul puts forth the basic doctrines of the faith, and the picture of God's life for us. It is the classic setting-out of the Gospel.In this series, Tom Wright has undertaken a tremendous task: to provide guides to all the books of the New Testament and to include in them his own translation of the entire text. Each short passage is followed by a highly readable discussion, with background information, useful explanations and suggestions, and thoughts as to how the text can be relevant to our lives today. A glossary is included at the back of each book. The series is suitable for group study, personal use, or daily devotions.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nN.T. (Tom) Wright is the Bishop of Durham in the Church of England. He is a prolific author and noted New Testament scholar, and was named by Christianity Today in 1999 as one of the top five theologians in the world.
