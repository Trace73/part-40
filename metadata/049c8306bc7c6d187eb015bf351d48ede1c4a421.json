Or make up \nyour own and email them. They are lonely, isolated, dangerous men, \ndesperately seeking connections in cyberspace and beyond. They'll likely \nrespond. Maybe even show up on your birthday and do balloon sculptures.\n\nWHAT IS PUKE &amp; SNOT?\nIt's a comedy act. Seriously.\n\nWHERE DID THE NAME COME FROM?\nAll the good ones were taken. Truthfully, check out the 60's Broadway hit \nBEYOND THE FRINGE, written and performed by Peter Cooke, Dudley Moore, \nAlan Bennett and one other guy. The answer is in one of the sketches in that \nsatirical revue.\n\nDO THEY DO THIS FOR A LIVING?\nNo, they do it for the art. What kind of a stupid question is that?\n\nCAN I HIRE THEM FOR MY EVENT?\nYou're too kind. You're too generous. You're too far away, you'll have to fly \nthem in. Sure, if it doesn't interfere with their regular golf outings, they'll be \nthere.\n\nHAVE THEY EVER WORKED WITH ANY FAMOUS ACTORS?\nHave you heard of Tom Hanks? Clint Eastwood? Julia Roberts? Jennifer \nAniston? Well, so have they.\n\nARE THEY REALLY ACTORS?\nOK, now you're pissing them off.
