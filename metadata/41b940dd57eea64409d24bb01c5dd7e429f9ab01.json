This huge and splendid volume tells the grim tale of the final collapse of the Third Reich. It does so from the viewpoints of the upper millstone (the Western Allies), the lower millstone (the Russians) and the grain being ground in between (the Germans). The research includes previously untapped Russian archives (particularly in the accounts of Soviet veterans) and leads to a gripping and horrifying story that serious students of military history will find almost impossible to put down. The blunders recounted are numerous, from the Allied failure to open Antwerp in the fall of 1944 to the Russian frontal assault on Berlin, and the Wehrmacht is depicted as the best army of the war and also the most atrocious in its treatment of civilians. Indeed, the treatment of civilians is a major theme, since they were slaughtered on a scale unheard of since the Thirty Years' War, and not only the Nazi camp inmates but also the inhabitants of Poland and East Prussia were numbered among the victims. The author hands out praise and blame with his usual edged aplomb (Anglophile readers may be happy to see a partial rehabilitation of Montgomery) and willingness to engender controversy, and also with his usual thorough research and clear writing (along with 24 pages of photos) to sustain every case he makes. His book ranks among the very best military history volumes of the year.\n\nFrom Bookmarks Magazine\n\nDrawing on untapped Russian archives, Hastings (a former war correspondent and leading military historian) rethinks the final year of World War II in this sequel to Overlord (1984), an account of the Normandy landings. He writes with authority, technical mastery, and profound sympathy for the victims of war, particularly German civilians. Although much of this story has been told before, Hastings casts new light on the warÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s devastating tolls on lowly GIs, confused civilians, and commanding officers. According to a few critics, he underplays the Allied forcesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ strategic errors and paints black-and-white portraits of both sides; he barely masks his disdain for the Anglo-Americans and admiration for the WehrmachtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s professionalism. He all but ignores the war in southern Europe. But these are minor quibbles. For military buffs, Armageddon is a first-rate history. \n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41b940dd57eea64409d24bb01c5dd7e429f9ab01","amp;dn":"Armageddon%3A+The+Battle+For+Germany%2C+1944-1945+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41b940dd57eea64409d24bb01c5dd7e429f9ab01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,185,64,221,87,238,166,68,9,210,75,176,28,93,215,228,41,249,171,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
