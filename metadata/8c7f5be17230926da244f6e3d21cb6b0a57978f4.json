The fifth edition continues to expose readers to the broad field of electronics at a level that can be easily understood, with all-new information on circuit board fabrication, assembly, and repair as well as practical applications and troubleshooting.\n\nColor has been added to all drawings and photos that supplement the descriptions of important concepts and techniques, making it even easier to master basic theory. Coverage is divided into six sections - DC Circuits, AC Circuits, Semiconductor Devices, Linear Circuits, Digital Circuits, and now, Practical Applications - a new section providing hands-on opportunities to apply DC/AC principles. \n-------------------\t\n\nThis is a re-upload of a previous torrent by another user which can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7117627/Introduction_to_Electronics__5th_edition&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7117627/Introduction_to_Electronics__5th_edition&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThat version had two blank pages and caused Acrobat to give error messages and sometimes hang up(depending on the version.) This torrent contains the same PDF except that pages 429 and 434 have been partially restored but more importantly cause no errors with Acrobat. \n\nThis torrent contains no RARs, no Passwords, and no BS.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c7f5be17230926da244f6e3d21cb6b0a57978f4","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Electronics+5th+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c7f5be17230926da244f6e3d21cb6b0a57978f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,127,91,225,114,48,146,109,162,68,246,227,210,28,182,176,165,121,120,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
