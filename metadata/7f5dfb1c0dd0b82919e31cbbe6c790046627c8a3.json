Then Ecco braved the unknown waters to find and defeat this\nmenace that fed on the creatures of the sea.\n\nThe Vortex Queen, though weakened, was not destroyed. She followed\nEcco from her hive in deep space back to this new, nourishing planet.\nNow, plunging into the warm waters of Earth, she seeks out a deep\nchasm and sinks into the abyss, where she feeds upon the Earth as she\nspawns streams of Vortex young.\n\nHer feeding builds in strength, creating a downward current against\nwhich small fish struggle in vain. She is creating a new Vortex race,\nand her presence on Earth bodes doom for all its creatures\n\nEcco must rid the world of this engulfing evil. Even as he tumbles in\nthe waves, the future is unfolding. But must it be a dark future ruled\nby the Vortex and  lifeless, miserable and cold? Does Earth stand a\nchance?\n\nEcco must stop the Vortex He is the stone that splits the stream of\ntime. He now faces his most dangerous quest yet.
