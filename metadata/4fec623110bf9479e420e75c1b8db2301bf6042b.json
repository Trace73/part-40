Born on December 25, 1976, in Leiden, Holland, Armin became interested in music at an early age (his father was an avid record buyer). A close friend introduced him to the world of dance music, and the Dutch DJ and remixer Ben Liebrand quickly became his main inspiration. It led van Buuren to investigate the roots of the electronic music he was becoming fond of, and numerous Jarre and Schulze CDs were acquired. Computers and turntables were also purchased, and creating his own music became a priority.  \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tArmada Music\nCatalog:\t\tARMA112\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\nCD1\n\n01.Hymne (Feat.
