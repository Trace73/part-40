Only one year after their inaugural release (Questionable Video 1992), Plan B stepped to the fold under the guidance of Mike Ternasky and convincingly shrugged off the sophomore video jinx. In today's massive era of skate prominence, Virtual Reality remains a flick that's just as significant for its representation of the period's form and style, as it is for the bar raising development and progression that it depicts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cca4b3f0df4a2a863af860693c93d20029704ed","amp;dn":"Plan+B+-+Virtual+Reality+%5B1993%5D+-+%28classic+skateboarding+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cca4b3f0df4a2a863af860693c93d20029704ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,202,75,63,13,244,162,168,99,175,134,6,147,201,61,32,2,151,4,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
