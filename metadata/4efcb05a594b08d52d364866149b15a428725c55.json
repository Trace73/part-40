As hundreds of rescue workers\nwaited on the ground, United Airlines Flight 232 wallowed\ndrunkenly over the bluffs northwest of Sioux City.\nThe plane slammed onto the runway and burst into a vast\nfireball. The rescuers didn't move at first: nobody could\npossibly survive that crash. And then people began emerging\nfrom the summer corn that lined the runways. Miraculously,\n184 of 296 passengers lived.\n\nFlight 232: A Story of Disaster and Survival\nBy: Laurence Gonzales\nFormat: Epub\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 880\nISBN13: 978-0-393-24414-4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4efcb05a594b08d52d364866149b15a428725c55","amp;dn":"Flight+232+A+Story+of+Disaster+and+Survival+by+Laurence+Gonzales","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4efcb05a594b08d52d364866149b15a428725c55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,252,176,90,89,75,8,213,45,54,72,102,20,155,21,164,40,114,92,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
