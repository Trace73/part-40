Not Beta!!\nI included 10 languages Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹are in x32 and x64 respectively:\nEnglish, EspaÃƒÂ±ol, CatalÃƒÂ  (Catalan), Dansk (Danish), Deutsch (German), FranÃƒÂ§ais (French), Nederlands (Dutch), PortuguÃƒÂªs do Brasil (Portuguese Brazilian), PÃ‘Æ’Ã‘ï¿½Ã‘ï¿½ÃÂºÃÂ¸ÃÂ¹ (Russian), Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥Å“â€¹Ã¥â€šÂ³Ã§ÂµÂ± (Chinese Traditional)\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nWhat's new in the version 5.00:\n\n1. New RAR 5.0 archiving format. You can use &quot;RAR 5.0&quot; option\nin archiving dialog or -ma command line switch to create\nRAR 5.0 archives.\nOlder software including older WinRAR versions is not able to\ndecompress RAR 5.0 archives, so if you plan to send an archive\nto other people, it is necessary to take the compatibility issue\ninto consideration. You can select &quot;RAR&quot; instead of &quot;RAR5&quot; option\nin archiving dialog to create RAR 4.x archives compatible with\nprevious WinRAR versions.\n\n2. Changes in RAR 5.0 compression algorithm:\na) maximum compression dictionary size is increased up to 1 GB\nin 64 bit WinRAR. 32 bit WinRAR version can use up to 256 MB\ndictionary when creating an archive. Both 32 bit and 64 bit\nversions can unpack archives with any dictionary size,\nincluding 1 GB;\nb) default dictionary size for RAR 5.0 is 32 MB, typically resulting\nin higher compression ratio and lower speed than RAR 4.x 4 MB.\nYou can use &quot;Dictionary size&quot; archiving dialog option or -md\nswitch to change this value;\nc) -md switch syntax is modified to support larger dictionary\nsizes. Append 'k', 'm' and 'g' modifiers to specify the size\nin kilo-, mega- and gigabytes, like -md64m for 64 MB dictionary.\nIf modifiers are not present, megabytes are assumed,\nso -md64m is equal to -md64;\nd) RAR 5.0 format includes Intel IA-32 executable and delta\ncompression algorithms, but RAR 4.x text, audio, true color\nand Itanium algorithms are not supported. These excluded algorithms\nare not efficient for modern data types and hardware configurations;\ne) RAR 5.0 decompression can utilize several CPU cores.\nThough not to same extent as in compression algorithm,\nit improves the decompression speed on large files\nwith poorly compressible data or when using BLAKE2 checksums.\n\n3. Changes in RAR 5.0 archive format:\na) file times are stored as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\ninstead of former local time, making file exchange among\nseveral time zones more straightforward;\nb) file names and archive comments use UTF-8 encoding.\n\n4. RAR 5.0 recovery record is based on Reed-Solomon error correction\ncodes. If recovery record size is large enough, 5% and more,\nthe new error correction scheme provides much higher resistance to\nmultiple damages comparing to RAR 4.x recovery record.\nSmaller record, such as 1 - 2%, or less random damage type would\nresult in less difference between 4.x and 5.0. For single continuous\ndamage 4.x and 5.0 efficiency is about the same.\nAdditionally to usual data erasures, the new recovery record\nis able to detect deletions and insertions of much larger size\nthan in previous RAR versions. Maximum insertion size is several\nmegabytes. Maximum deletion size depends on the damage type\nand in some cases can be as large as the recovery record size.\nStill, the best recovery performance and efficiency is achieved\nif no deletions and insertions are present, so all data including\ndamaged sectors preserve their original positions. Thus, if you use\nsome special software to copy an archive from damaged media,\nit is better to choose the mode, when damaged sectors are filled by\nzeroes or any other data instead of cutting them out completely\nfrom resulting file.\nRAR 5.0 recovery record is more resistant to damage of recovery record\nitself and can utilize a partially corrupt recovery record data.\nNote, though, that &quot;Repair&quot; command does not fix broken blocks\nin recovery record. Only file data are corrected. After successful\narchive repair, you may need to create a new recovery record\nfor saved files.\nNew recovery record is not based on 512 byte sectors anymore\nand incorporates more complicated data structures. So it is impossible\nto specify its size in sectors. For RAR 5.0 archives the parameter of\n-rr[N] switch and rr[N] command is always treated as a percent of\narchive size regardless of presence of % character. Typically N%\nrecovery record can repair up to N% of continuously damaged data\nand increases the archive size by only slightly more than N%.\nAbility to fix multiple damages is proportional to N.\nWe used &quot;Screaming Fast Galois Field Arithmetic Using Intel\nSIMD Instructions&quot; paper by James S. Plank, Kevin M. Greenan\nand Ethan L. Miller to improve Reed-Solomon coding performance.\nAlso we are grateful to Artem Drobanov and Bulat Ziganshin\nfor samples and ideas allowed to make Reed-Solomon coding\nmore efficient.\n\n5. &quot;Test&quot; command verifies validity of RAR 5.0 recovery record.\nRecovery record is tested after processing all archived files.\nIf corrupt archive contains the recovery record, it might be possible\nto repair it even if recovery record validity test is failed.\n&quot;Repair&quot; command attempts to utilize even a partially damaged\nrecovery record. So treat the negative recovery record test result\nas a reason to re-create the archive if original files are still\navailable, but not as a reason to avoid &quot;Repair&quot; command.\n\n6. Changes in RAR 5.0 encryption algorithm:\na) encryption algorithm is changed from AES-128 to AES-256 in CBC mode.\nKey derivation function is based on PBKDF2 using HMAC-SHA256;\nb) special password verification value allows to detect most of\nwrong passwords without necessity to unpack the entire file;\nc) if archive headers are not encrypted (&quot;Encrypt file names&quot; option\nis off), file checksums for encrypted RAR 5.0 files are modified\nusing a special password dependent algorithm, to make impossible\nguessing file contents based on checksums. Do not expect such\nencrypted file checksums to match usual CRC32 and BLAKE2 values.\n\n7. RAR 5.0 archives allow to utilize 256 bit length BLAKE2sp hash\ninstead of 32 bit CRC32 as a file checksum.\nEnable &quot;Use BLAKE2 file checksum&quot; option in &quot;Options&quot; page of\narchiving dialog or specify -htb command line switch to use BLAKE2\nchecksums.\nWhile producing slightly larger archives, BLAKE2 can be used\nfor file contents identification. If two files have the same\nBLAKE2 value, it practically guarantees that file contents\nis the same. BLAKE2 error detection property is also stronger\nthan in much shorter CRC32.\n\n8. Features removed:\na) authenticity verification feature did not provide the required\nlevel of reliability and was removed;\nb) switch -en (do not add &quot;end of archive&quot; block) is not supported\nby RAR 5.0 archives, which always have the end of archive block.\nThis block helps WinRAR to safely skip external data like\ndigital signatures appended to archive;\nc) old style extension based arcname.rNN volume names are not\nsupported by RAR 5.0 archives, which use only arcname.partN.rar\nvolume names;\nd) file comments are not supported anymore both in RAR 4.x\nand RAR 5.0 archives. Console RAR 'cf' command is removed.\nIt does not affect the archive comment support, which is present\nin both versions of archive format and is not planned for removal.\n\n9. &quot;Set password&quot; command and &quot;Dictionary size&quot; option are moved to\n&quot;General&quot; page of archiving dialog.\n\n10. You can use &quot;Save symbolic links as links&quot; option on &quot;Advanced&quot; page\nof archiving dialog to save and restore NTFS symbolic links\nand reparse points as links, so their contents is not archived.\nCommand line equivalent of this option is -ol switch.\nSimilar option for NTFS hard links is &quot;Save hard links as links&quot;.\nIts command line equivalent is -oh switch.\nBoth options are available only for RAR 5.0 archive format.\n\n11. Added extraction only support for XZ archive format.\n\n12. Changes in recovery volume processing in RAR 5.0 archive format:\na) maximum number of RAR+REV volumes in RAR 5.0 format is 65535\ninstead of 255;\nb) recovery volume operations are faster than in RAR 4.x;\nc) additionally to recovery data, RAR 5.0 REV files also store\nservice information such as checksums of protected RAR files.\nSo they are slightly larger than RAR volumes which they protect.\nIf you plan to copy individual RAR and REV files to some removable\nmedia, you need to take it into account and specify RAR volume\nsize by a few kilobytes smaller than media size.\n\n13. Maximum path length for files in RAR and ZIP archives is increased\nup to 2048 characters.\n\n14. Command line RAR returns the exit code 11 if it can detect that\nuser entered a wrong password. This code can be returned only\nfor RAR 5.0 archives. It is impossible to distinguish a wrong\npassword and data damage for RAR 4.x archives.\n\n15. 'v' and 'l' commands display archived file names in the end of line,\nnot in that beginning as before. Also some fields previously\navailable in 'l' and 'v' output are now shown only by 'lt' and 'vt'.\n'vt' and 'lt' commands provide the detailed multiline information\nfor every archived file.\n'vta' and 'lta' also include service headers into list.\n\n16. Now the default charset for filelists in commands like\n'rar a arcname @filelist' is ANSI for both WinRAR and console RAR.\nIn previous versions it was ANSI for WinRAR and OEM for console RAR.\nYou can use -scl switch to override this default.\n\n17. Internal WinRAR viewer can detect and display files in UTF-8\nand UTF-16 little endian encodings.\n\n18. UTF-16 little endian encoding is used in RAR and WinRAR log file\nrar.log, so Unicode file names are stored in the log correctly.\nWinRAR automatically truncates the old rar.log file in non-Unicode\nformat to avoid mixing different encoding in the same log file.\nIn case of console RAR you need to delete the old rar.log manually,\notherwide RAR will append UTF-16 messages to existing rar.log.\nYou can use -scg switch to change the default log file\nencoding, such as -scag for ANSI encoding.\n\n19. Command line 'r' (repair) command can include an optional destpath\nparameter defining the destination folder for repaired archive:\nrar r archive.rar destpath\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n\nInstrucciones:\n\n1.- Instala el programa de acuerdo a tu sistema: x32 o x64.
