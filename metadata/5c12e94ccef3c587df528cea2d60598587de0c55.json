Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann takes place in a fictional future in which human beings have been forced under Earth's surface and live in isolated subterranean civilizations. These &quot;villages&quot; have no contact with the surface world or other villages.\n\nGiha Village, one of the underground villages, regularly experiences earthquakes; because these earthquakes damage infrastructure, the village must constantly extend deeper into the earthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½individuals relegated to this task are known as &quot;Diggers&quot;. Giha Village is the home of Simon, a fourteen-year-old digger who was orphaned when his parents were killed in an earthquake. Although Simon is respected by the village elders as the best of the diggers, he is ostracized by his peers. Simon discovers a special drill key deep in the ground and is soon recruited by an eccentric fellow orphan named Kamina into his group, the &quot;Gurren Brigade&quot;. Kamina dreams of the surface world, which he once visited as a child, though he had to return home as he was too young to survive there.\n\ngenre: Ecchi, Humour, Action, Mecha.\n\nTbqh..
