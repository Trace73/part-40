Singers like Elvis Costello have acknowledged a creative debt to him, and his albums, especially American Gothic, have become cult favorites. --- Subway to the Country is not the classic that American Gothic is, but it remains a fine testament to Ackles' truly awesome poetic power as both a writer and a singer. \n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
