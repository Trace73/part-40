The original trackers should still be included, I think.  This is the first time I've tried to upload a torrent this way.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis's &quot;The VS. Redux&quot; from 2010.  It is a rerelease of the 2009 &quot;The VS. EP&quot;.  &quot;The VS. Redux&quot; is all of the &quot;The VS. EP&quot; tracks plus extra remixes.\n\nThe files are in FLAC format, how I found them.  You'll have to convert them for iTunes.\n\nThe album art is not included, again, how I found it.\n\nHope this finds its way to whoever wants it.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcbb4f7a3222facbf16d969de9bb1a73e8399605","amp;dn":"Macklemore+%26amp%3B+Ryan+Lewis+-+The+VS.+Redux+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcbb4f7a3222facbf16d969de9bb1a73e8399605","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,187,79,122,50,34,250,203,241,109,150,157,233,187,26,115,232,57,150,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
