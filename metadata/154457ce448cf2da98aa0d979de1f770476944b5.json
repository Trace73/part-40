Lots of creative fight scenes (Jackie Chan does &quot;drunken boxing&quot; better than anyone!), filmed very well, with characters you care about; interesting sets and cinematography; and a good, simple plot. Top this off with an irresistible performance by the ever-naughty Anita Mui and a great soundtrack, and you&amp;#039;ve got a real winner. \n\nAvg. Rating:  4.8 / 5 (based on 54 ratings). What did you think of it?  \n\nPlot: When the British government is discovered smuggling precious Chinese artifacts out of the country, folklore hero Wong Fei Hong uses his uniquely outlandish style of martial arts--drunken boxing--to salvage the valuables before it&amp;#039;s too late! \n \nOverview: This sequel to 1978&amp;#039;s DRUNKEN MASTER features Jackie Chan returning to his role as the mischievous martial artist who outsmarts his father and tangles with Euro-thugs in the streets of Hong Kong in order to rescue stolen Chinese artifacts. Chan employs the hilarious but effective style of kung fu known as the &quot;drunken&quot; style. The movie is a true action masterpiece featuring some of the most intense fighting sequences ever filmed. \n \nCast: Jackie Chan  ||  Anita Mui Yim-Fong  ||  Ti Lung  ||  Felix Wong (Yat Wa)  ||  Liu Chia Liang  ||  Hoh Wing Fong  ||  Cheung Chi Gwong  ||  Andy Lau Tak-Wah  ||  Ken Lo Wai-Kwong  ||  Chin Kar Lok  ||  Yvonne Yung Hung  \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.534655/qx/details.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.534655/qx/details.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nP.S.\nSubtitles file for &quot;New Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; available at:\n\n_________________\nDo not break the share chain!
