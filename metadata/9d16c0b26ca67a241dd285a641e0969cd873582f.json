He is noted for his military prowess, commanding the forces of Prophet Muhammad SAWW and those of his immediate successors of the Rashidun Caliphate; Caliph Abu Bakr R.A and Caliph Umar R.A during the Islamic conquest in 7th century.\n\nIn having the distinction of being undefeated in over a hundred battles against the numerically superior forces of the Byzantine Roman Empire, Sassanid Persian Empire, and their allies, he is regarded as one of the finest military commanders in history.\nQuotes of Khalid Bin Waleed (R.A)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Do you see a space of the span of a hand on my leg, chest, arm which is not covered by some scar of the wound of a sword or an arrow or a lance?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to one of his friend few days before he died, four years after dismissal from army.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you were in the clouds, Allah would raise us to you or lower you to us for battle.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to the Byzantine troops when they retreated from the battle field to the fortified town of Chalcis.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When I am in the battlefield, I love it more then when I am in my house.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The rainy night when I am standing wearing armor with sword and shield in my hand and looking again and again towards the eastern horizon, waiting for sun to rise so that I could start the battle.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this after getting d{spam link removed} from army by Caliph Umar in 638 A.D.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Submit to Islam and be safe. Or agree to the payment of the Jizya, and you and your people will be under our protection, else you will have only yourself to blame for the consequences, for I bring the men who desire death as ardently as you desire life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis letter was writen by Khalid to Persian Governor of Mesopotamia before invading it.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“When Allah decides a matter, it is done.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have dedicated my life to the way of Allah, Most High.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Man intends one thing, but Allah intends another.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The earth destroys its fools, but the intelligent destroy the earth.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If you are truthful you will survive. If you lie you shall perish.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am the noble warrior, I am the Sword of Allah, I am Khalid bin Al Waleed.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nThese were the famous verses that Khalid use to recite in the battle field.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am the son of many chiefs. My sword is sharp and terrible. It is the mightiest of things When the pot of war boils fiercely.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am the pillar of Islam! I am the Companion of the Prophet! I am the noble warrior, Khalid bin Al Waleed!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I will give you three days, if the gates are not opened on these revised terms, I shall attack. And then there shall be no terms of any kind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am the son of Al Walid ! Will anyone duel?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“By my faith, the water will go to whichever army is more steadfast and more deserving.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this before the decisive Battle of Walaja, when Muslim army ran short of water.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“O Lord! If you give us victory, I shall see that no enemy warrior is left alive until their river runs with their blood!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this during Battle of Ullais which is also known as Battle of blood river.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“At Battle of MuÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tah I broke nine swords in my hand. But I have never met an enemy like the Persians. And among the Persians I have never met an enemy like the army of Battle of Ullais.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGave tribute to the brave Persian soldiers after the bloody Battle of Ullais.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Wait a while; there will come to you mounts, carrying lions in shining armor, battalions followed by battalions.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nWrote this letter to Ayaz bin Ghanam who asked him for reinforcement while fighting against the rebel Arab tribes in northern Arabia.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I see that these people know nothing about war.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this about Persian and Christian Arab recruits in Persian army after analysing the siege of An al Tamar in Iraq.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We shall take this route; let not your resolve be weakened. Know that the help of Allah comes according to your desire. Let not the Muslims fear anything so long as they have the help of Allah.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this when one of his commander tried to stop him from taking a dangerous rout direct to Syria from Iraq through Syrian desert and said that ..You cannot take this route with an army. By Allah, even a lone traveler would attempt it at the peril of his life. It involves five days of extreme hardship without a drop of water and the ever-present danger of losing the way.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“But for the necessity of obeying the orders of the Caliph, I would never have accepted this command over you. You are much higher than me in Islam. I am a Companion of the Prophet, but you are one whom the Messenger of Allah had called Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthe trusted one of this nation.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah while taking over from him the command of Muslim army in Syria, in reply Abu Ubaidah saidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I have received with gladness the letter of Abu Bakr appointing you commander over me. There is no resentment in my heart, for I know your skill in matters of war.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Take her as a gift, there shall be no ransom. Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this while handing over the daughter of Emperor Heraclius who was captured after Battle of Maraj al debaj in which HeraculusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son-in-law Thomas, was killed in duel with Khalid. Heraclius wrote following letter to KhalidÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I have come to know what you have done to my army. You have killed my son-in-law and captured my daughter. You have won and got away safely. I now ask you for my daughter. Either return her to me on payment of ransom or give her to me as a gift, for honour is a strong element in your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Praise be to Allah who decreed death upon Abu Bakr, who was more beloved to me than Umar. Praise be to Allah who gave authority to Umar, who was less beloved to me than Abu Bakr, and compelled me to love him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this some time before his death, Caliph Abu Bakr made him commander in chief of army. while Caliph Umar d{spam link removed} Khalid from army. Though relations of Khalid with his cousin Umar always remained something short of cordial, but magnificent and just rule of Umar impressed Khalid a lot and he on his death bequeathed his property to `Umar and made him the executor of his will and estate.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“May Allah have mercy upon Abu Bakr! Had he lived, I would not have been removed from command.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this on the death of [[w:Abu Bakr|Caliph Abu Bakr, when his successor Caliph Umar d{spam link removed} Khalid from command and made Abu Ubaidah, the new commander in chief.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“If Abu Bakr is dead and Umar is Caliph, then we hear and obey.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this After the death of Abu Bakr.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“By Allah, if you were to appoint a small child over me, I would obey him. How could I not obey you when you are far above me in Islam and have been named the Trusted One by the Prophet? I could never attain your status. I declare here and now that I have dedicated my life to the way of Allah, Most High.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to Abu Ubaidah, after being removed from command by Caliph Umar for no reason.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“These Romans were the bravest that I had ever met.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nGave tribute to the Byzantine soldiers after winning Battle of Emesa.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“How few are the Romans and how numerous are we ! Ã¢â‚¬ËœAn armyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strength lies not in numbers of men but in AllahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s help, and its weakness lies in being forsaken by AllahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to one of his soldier at Battle of Yarmouk who said that ..How numerous are the Romans and how few are we.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I protest to the Muslims against what you have done. By Allah, you have been unjust to me, O Umar!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to Caliph Umar who d{spam link removed} him from army in 638.\n\nCaliph Umar RA removed Khaled bin Walid R.A from the army because Umar R.A is afraid that people might start to think that Khalid R.A is the cause of victory and might forget that victory come from Allah SWT.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Umar appointed me over Syria until it turned to wheat and honey; then d{spam link removed} me!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSaid this to his wife after bneing removed from army.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Praise be to Allah who took Abu Bakr R.A away. He was dearer to me than Umar R.A. Praise be to Allah who appointed Umar R.A in authority He was hateful to me, but I grew to like him.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“And here I am, dying in my bed, like cattle die. May the eyes of cowards never sleep.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n..........................\n\nBrowse my other torrents :)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SamirDZ/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease seed after you finish, and share with others anywhere not just through the net only (flash disks, burn to disks, send via emails...etc) to friends, colleagues, relatives, neighbors....\nI hope that you will benefit from the books and stuff :)\nSHARING IS CARING :p","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d16c0b26ca67a241dd285a641e0969cd873582f","amp;dn":"khalid+Bin+Walleed+The+Sword+Of+Allah.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d16c0b26ca67a241dd285a641e0969cd873582f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,22,192,178,108,166,122,36,29,210,133,166,65,224,150,156,216,115,88,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
