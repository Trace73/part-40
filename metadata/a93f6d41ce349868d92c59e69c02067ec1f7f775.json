One of the most admired writers in the Spanish-speaking world, Fuentes was a catalyst, along with Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Julio CortÃƒÂ¡zar, of the explosion of Latin American literature in the 1960s-1970s, known as El Boom.  He wrote plays, short stories, political nonfiction and novels, many of them chronicles of tangled love.  His many literary honors included the Miguel de Cervantes Prize as well as Mexico's highest award, the Belisario DomÃƒÂ­nguez Medal of Honor.  He was often named as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, though he never won.\n\nFuentes's first novel, WHERE THE AIR IS CLEAR (1958), describes life in Mexico City in the 1940s and 50s, with its heady mixture of Spanish, indigenous and more contemporary Mexican elements.  The linguistic and formal experimentation in the book brought him to the attention of reviewers in Mexico and abroad, but it was his second novel, THE DEATH OF ARTEMIO CRUZ (1962) that won him recognition as one of Latin America's leading young authors.  The book centres on the Mexican revolution (1910-20) and its effect on succeeding generations.  It is still considered by many to be Fuentes's masterpiece because of its psychological insights, again with formal experimentation.\n\nOther major novels from this period were A CHANGE OF SKIN (1967) and the 350,000-word, all-encompassing TERRA NOSTRA (1975), which spans more than 2,000 years of history and has been called &quot;a panoramic Hispano-American creation myth.&quot;  In his 60s and 70s, Fuentes produced a stream of novels and essays that deepened his investigation into the possibilities of fiction, in works such as THE CRYSTAL FRONTIER (1997), THE YEARS WITH LAURA DÃƒï¿½AZ (1999), and INEZ (2003).  Some of these were less well received than his earlier work, but THE EAGLE'S THRONE (2003), an epistolary novel comically taking apart the complexities and absurdities of Mexican political life, was seen by many critics as a return to form.\n\nHis novels remained ambitious and topical to the end.  His last, DESTINY AND DESIRE (2011), is a sprawling work that Michael Wood described as &quot;not exactly a parody of War and Peace, but certainly a spectral, playful revision of the idea of a novel that competes with history.&quot;\n\nAmong the non-fiction included here, MYSELF WITH OTHERS (1988) assembles essays reflecting three of the great elements of his work: autobiography, love of literature, and politics.  They include his reflections on his beginning as a writer, his celebrated Harvard University commencement address, and his trenchant examinations of Cervantes, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Borges.  THE BURIED MIRROR (1992) is a fascinating and richly illustrated journey through five hundred years of Spanish and Latin American history.\n\nIn THIS I BELIEVE (2005), Fuentes surveys the wellsprings of art and ideology, the events that have shaped our time, and his extraordinary life and fiercest passions.  Arranged alphabetically from &quot;Amore&quot; to &quot;Zurich,&quot; Fuentes ranges wide, from contradictions inherent in Latin American culture and politics to his long friendship with director Luis BuÃƒÂ±uel; reflections on the mixed curse and blessing of globalization; memories of a sexual initiation in Zurich; a fond tracing of a family tree heavy with poets, dreamers, and diplomats; evocations of the streets, cafÃƒÂ©s, and bedrooms of Washington, Paris, Santiago de Chile, Cambridge, Oaxaca, and New York; and a celebration of literary heroes including Balzac, Cervantes, Faulkner, Kafka, and Shakespeare.\n\nThroughout his life, wherever he lived, Mexico was the centre of Fuentes's artistic preoccupations.  In his late 70s, he provided a typically graphic description of the attraction he felt for his own land: &quot;It's a very enigmatic country, and that's a good thing because it keeps us alert, makes us constantly try to decipher the enigma of Mexico, the mystery of Mexico, to understand a country that is very, very baroque, very complicated and full of surprises.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n\n                                    == Novels ==\n\n* ADAM IN EDEN (Dalkey Archive, 2012).
