Most are small and tactile, often worn as a fob.\r\nMany are made from coins and brass from the battlefield; some are carved in bone and wood.\r\nMost belonged to young soldiers who were killed in action or died of their wounds - at Gallipoli, France and Flanders, Palestine and Mesopotamia.\r\nTwelve belonged to Anzacs.\r\nThis book tells their stories - of men from England, Scotland, Wales, Australia and New Zealand, bound by adventure and loyalty to their common ancestry.\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nThe engraved ID holds the key to the story. The heart of each story is different.\r\nThere are stories of courage under fire and desertions at Colombo; of death from sunstroke and survival through three theatres of war; of medals awarded and fines for misadventures; of men from the Outback in Queensland and young lads from Boys Homes in Kent.\r\nThere are insights into social history - the ostracism and disgrace of venereal disease, the generational poverty in industrial cities, the imperative to secure oil lines in Iraq.\r\nAnd there are heartbroken letters from those left behind.\r\n. . . . .\r\n\r\nThis book will appeal to collectors of artefacts, coins and militaria.\r\nIt will also appeal to those interested in family history, social history, military history and art therapy in trauma. So much can be found from so little.\r\nThe range of artefacts may also interest researchers. There are over 64 artefacts in all, including two from the Boer War, one from Crimea, and seven from the convict era - all bearing testament to the primal need to carve a name.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nFOREWORD\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\nPREFACE\r\nCHAPTER 1 PERSONAL TRENCH ART\r\nCHAPTER 2 THE COLLECTION\r\nCHAPTER 3 THE PIECES\r\nCHAPTER 4 THE RESEARCH\r\nCHAPTER 5 STORY COINS\r\nCHAPTER 6 A PERSONAL PIECE\r\nCHAPTER 7 STORIES FROM FORGOTTEN PIECES\r\nRESEARCH NOTES\r\nRESEARCH CLUES\r\nABOUT THIS BOOK\r\nREFERENCES\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\nINDEX\r\n \nhttp://s29.postimg.org/72xiubutz/Trench_Art_The_Stories_Behind_the_Talismans.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f314601f178d90bf88c3a9c20358a7fa47e211","amp;dn":"Trench+Art+-+The+Stories+Behind+the+Talismans+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f314601f178d90bf88c3a9c20358a7fa47e211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,243,20,96,31,23,141,144,191,136,195,169,194,3,88,167,250,71,226,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
