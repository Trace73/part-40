Alan G\r\nParker's documentary Hello Quo, specially re-edited for the BBC, recounts the\r\nband's epic story from the beginning - when south London schoolmates Francis\r\nRossi and Alan Lancaster formed their first band with big ambitions of rock\r\n'n' roll domination, quickly adding drummer John Coghlan and guitarist Rick\r\nParfitt.\r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of Quo's hits from their unusually psychedelic early\r\nhit, Pictures of Matchstick Men, followed by a run through their classics from\r\nDown Down to Whatever You Want.\r\n\r\nThe band laughs off the constant ribbing about only using three chords and the\r\nfilm explores how Quo's heads-down boogie defined UK rock in the early '70s.\r\nFender Stratocaster in hand, Quo have stood their ground and never shifted, but\r\nthey have managed to adapt to scoring pop hits over five decades.\r\n\r\nThe original members of the 'frantic four' tell their story of a life in rock\r\n'n' roll, alongside interviews from some prominent Quo fans, such as Paul Weller,\r\nwhose first gig was the Quo at Guildford Civic Hall, to Brian May, who waxes\r\nlyrically about the opening riff to Pictures of Matchstick Men, while even Sir\r\nCliff plays homage to the denim-clad rockers.\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/40010834965568842361.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/57702068390627378191.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/76596877840142934829.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 825 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1200 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 1h 18mn","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b5c05ea02f2183798bb4ae646a5bb91e33a13f3","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Hello+Quo+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b5c05ea02f2183798bb4ae646a5bb91e33a13f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,92,5,234,2,242,24,55,152,187,74,230,70,165,187,145,227,58,19,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
