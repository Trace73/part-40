In entries on every work shown and wide-ranging essays accompanied by 297 black-and-white and full-color illustrations, eight American and European authorities explore the richness and diversity of Tiepolo's achievements. They reveal enormous variety within his oeuvre, demonstrating that he was one of the presiding geniuses of the European imagination, the greatest artist of 18th century Venice, and, excepting only Goya and David, of 18th century Europe. The essays focus on Tiepolo's formation; his mastery of mythological and poetic subjects; his deeply moving religious pictures; his rare excursions into portraiture and studies of ideal heads; and the process by which he proceeded from initial ideas to larger scale canvases and frescoes. Written for the scholar and general reader alike, these texts are lavishly supported by illustrations of Tiepolo's works and those of his predecessors and contemporaries. A documented chronology of Tiepolo's life and art, detailed provenances, references, and a bibliography are provided. No art library collection on European art history can be considered complete without the inclusion of Giambattista Tiepolo: 1696-1770.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d25f0dca538acae4ccb2a4edf574fbb5a6bd4d3","amp;dn":"Giambattista+Tiepolo+1696-1770+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d25f0dca538acae4ccb2a4edf574fbb5a6bd4d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,37,240,220,165,56,172,174,76,203,42,78,223,87,79,187,90,107,212,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
