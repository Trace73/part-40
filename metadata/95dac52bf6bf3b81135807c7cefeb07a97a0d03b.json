This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\nIn this broadcast:\n\nSince &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; has songs in the countdown, Casey tells of its film location. It is a Texas bar which seats 3000 people and fits another 2,000 on the dance floor.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;What songwriter in chart history has written the most songs in a single year?&quot;\n\nCasey tells the interesting and true story of the real Tom Dooley.\n\nCasey tells about one artist on the chart who is the most successful female song writer of the rock era. She has hit the chart 98 times.\n\nThere is a group in the coundown where the former lead singer had a preminition and chose his replacement two months before he died. Casey tells the story.\n\nAt number one in the countdown, is a song that was the flip side of the studio recording that was actually released. (The wrong side hit number one.)\n\nThis is a really great contdown. The songs have interesting chord progressions and songs 32 and 30 are both duets with great harmonies.\n\nLW#3: The Rose Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bette Midler\nLW#2: Funky Town Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lipps Inc.\nLW#1: Coming Up Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Paul McCartney\n40:    Make A Little Magic Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Dirt Band\n39:    Jo Jo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boz Scaggs\n38:    King Of The Hill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rick Pinette And Oak        \n37:    Old Fashion Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores     \n36:    Into The Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Benny Mardones     \n35:    Take A Little Rhythm - Ali Thomson    \n34:    Walks Like A Lady - Journey\n33:    Call Me - Blondie\n32:    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Fall In Love With A Dreamer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers With Kim Carnes\nArchive: Teen Angel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mark Denning\n31:    Let Me Love Open The Door Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pete Townsend\n30:    ShouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Never Let You Go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Sedaka &amp; Dara Sedaka\n29:    Cars Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Gary Numan    \n28:    Stand By Me Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Mickey Gilley\n27:    Misunderstanding - Genesis\n26:    Sailing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Christopher Cross\n25:    The Empire Strikes Back - Meco\nLDD: We Are Family Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sister Sledge\n24:    SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Out Of My Life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Jackson\n23:    All Night Long Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Joe Walsh\n22:    Emotional Rescue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Rolling Stones\nArchive: Theme From Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Summer PlaceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Percy Faith\n21:    Love The World Away Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n20:    Gimme Some LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Blues Brothers\n19:    Take Your Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The S.O.S.
