This file has been tested and plays perfect. If it doesn't work for you, then your equipment cannot play 1080p.\n\n\nVERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. \n\nAnd a special F**K OFF to users like 'CyndiLauperNow' who continue to take the files and claim them as his/her own work.  I am all for sharing, but give credit where credit is due.  Reb made this file, not you.\n\nShare this file anywhere you want.
