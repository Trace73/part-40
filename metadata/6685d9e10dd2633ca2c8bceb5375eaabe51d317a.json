When a new home can be found for them, they are lovingly and painstakingly rebuilt. These are not grand buildings, but everyday buildings that give an extraordinary insight into the lives of the people who lived and worked in them. Deep within their fabric are preserved astonishing stories about how we lived and worked.\n\n\n\n\n3)  Part 3 \nIn the final episode, a mysterious medieval building on the quayside at Haverfordwest was dismantled 30 years ago by a team of young apprentices. Charlie helps those same men reconstruct the seemingly fortified vaulted house at the Welsh National History Museum. Dan sets out to discover what the building actually was and uncovers stories of wealthy merchants, pirates and the English invasion of South Wales.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img40.imageshack.us/img40/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img207.imageshack.us/img207/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img444.imageshack.us/img444/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/6431/brickbybrickrebuildingo.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1545 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 400\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.800 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 29\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 701 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beamish.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rafmuseum.org.uk/london/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6685d9e10dd2633ca2c8bceb5375eaabe51d317a","amp;dn":"BBC+Brick+by+Brick+Rebuilding+Our+Past+3of3+PDTV+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6685d9e10dd2633ca2c8bceb5375eaabe51d317a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,133,217,225,13,210,99,60,162,200,188,235,83,117,234,171,229,29,49,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
