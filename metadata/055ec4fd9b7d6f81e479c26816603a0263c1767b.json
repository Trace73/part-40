She is regarded as one of the finest 'pure country' vocalists and continues to tour the world entertaining her loyal fans. Her personal singing hero, George Jones, has referred to her as &quot;one of the greatest country singers that has ever stepped up to the microphone.&quot;And Merle Haggard was so taken with her vocal abilities that he married her (a union they would both come to regret.)\nWilliams began her career as a teenager in her home state of Missouri with her own local radio show, before moving to Nashville and signing with Hickory Records in 1968. She recorded such classics as Once More, Yes Ma'm (He Found Me In A Honky Tonk) and Country Girl With Hot Pants On. She moved on to RCA Records and then MCA, where she worked with future husband Merle Haggard, and top-notch producers like Porter Wagoner. This set features 82 classic tracks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of her studio recordings, including several previously unreleased tracks, for Hickory, and a complete unreleased LP produced in 1986 by Tompall Glaser. A detailed discography and liner notes by Randy Fox, drawn from extensive interviews with Williams, tell the story of her incredible life and career.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:055ec4fd9b7d6f81e479c26816603a0263c1767b","amp;dn":"Leona+Williams++-+Yes%2C+Ma%27m%2C+He+Found+Me+In+A+Honky+Tonk+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"055ec4fd9b7d6f81e479c26816603a0263c1767b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,94,196,253,155,125,111,129,228,121,194,104,22,96,58,2,99,193,118,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
