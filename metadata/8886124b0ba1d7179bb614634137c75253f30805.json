One of the greatest scientists of his day, Faraday held the position of Fullerian Professor of Chemistry at the Royal Institution of Great Britain for over thirty years. Not long after his death, his friend Henry Bence Jones attempted 'to join together his words, and to form them into a picture of his life which may be almost looked upon as an autobiography'. Jones' compilation of Faraday's manuscripts, letters, notebooks, and other writings resulted in this Life and Letters (1870) which remains an important resource for learning more about one of the most influential scientific experimentalists of the nineteenth century. Volume 1 is devoted to his early career, while Volume 2 describes his research on electricity, his work as a scientific adviser to the government and industry and his service to education","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8886124b0ba1d7179bb614634137c75253f30805","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Letters+of+Faraday%2C+Volume+2+%28502p%29+%5BInua%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8886124b0ba1d7179bb614634137c75253f30805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,134,18,75,11,161,215,23,155,182,20,99,65,55,199,82,83,243,8,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
