Until the appearance of Concentration Camp Majdanek, the only works on Majdanek were authored by historians serving or trained under PolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communist regime. Mattogno and Graf have filled this glaring research gap with a monumental study that expertly dissects and repudiates the myth of homicidal gas chambers at Majdanek. Based on exhaustive research of the primary sources and of the physical remainders of the former concentration camp, this book strikes a death blow to the lie of homicidal gassings at Majdanek. The authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ investigations lead to unambiguous and unsparing conclusions about the real history and the actual functioning of the camp which thoroughly destroy the official theses without excusing the abuses tolerated by MajdanekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wartime commanders. With Concentration Camp Majdanek, Mattogno and Graf have once again produced a careful, methodical investigative work that sets the standard for all other treatments of Majdanek","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:509629dc8dfa4c5de27c944494eb10938f95cf98","amp;dn":"Concentration+Camp+Majdanek%3A+A+Historical+and+Technical+Study","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"509629dc8dfa4c5de27c944494eb10938f95cf98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,150,41,220,141,250,76,93,226,124,148,68,148,235,16,147,143,149,207,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
