(AMG)\n\n\nSacred City was Shriekback's last release. Rather than showing any sign of decline as so many bands do, this disc instead demonstrates the full flowering of the band's talent. \nFrom the industrial Bastard Sons of Enoch to the joyful Hymn to the Local Gods, the album uses a variety of musical styles to explore all facets of the city as an archetype (although Londoners may recognize their city perhaps more than any other). The two instrumental pieces, 3AM and Underground, are not so much music as atmosphere, hauntingly capturing the essence of night in the city with minimalistic genius. \nWell worth acquiring and listening to repeatedly. (I also recommend walking though your city while playing it on headphones. It will make you appreciate your city and Shriekback's Sacred City in a whole different way.)
