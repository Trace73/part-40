This file has been tested and plays perfect. If it doesn't work for you, then your equipment cannot play 1080p.\n\nVERY SPECIAL thanks to Reb for the file. \n\nAnd a special F**K OFF to users like 'CyndiLauperNow' who continue to take the files and claim them as his/her own work.  I am all for sharing, but give credit where credit is due.  Reb made this file, not you.\n\nShare this file anywhere you want. But please don't rename it. \n\n\nFile              : Cyndi.Lauper.Still.So.Unusual.S01E07.Cyndis.Smash.Hit.1080p.HDTV.x264-WETV.mp4\nFormat            : MPEG-4 at 8 664 Kbps\nLength            : 1.27 GiB for 20mn 59s 692ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 8 509 Kbps\nAspect            : 1920 x 1080 (1.778) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AAC at 151 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ae5106bd004ade60bc8cdb433371a6857ad66e8","amp;dn":"Cyndi.Lauper.Still.So.Unusual.S01E07.Cyndis.Smash.Hit.1080p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ae5106bd004ade60bc8cdb433371a6857ad66e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,229,16,107,208,4,173,230,11,200,205,180,51,55,26,104,87,173,102,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
