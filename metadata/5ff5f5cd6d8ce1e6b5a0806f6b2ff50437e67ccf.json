Oddball instruments Ã¢â‚¬â€ pennywhistles, mandolins Ã¢â‚¬â€ pop up like disordered wraiths over gritty drum tracks that sound like they were recorded in a cluttered cellar. Mellencamp himself mutters and snarls in a voice of tangled complexity, worrying his way through songs about trouble.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ff5f5cd6d8ce1e6b5a0806f6b2ff50437e67ccf","amp;dn":"John+Mellencamp+-+Human+Wheels+%5Brock%5D+%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ff5f5cd6d8ce1e6b5a0806f6b2ff50437e67ccf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,245,245,205,109,140,225,230,181,160,128,111,107,47,245,4,55,230,124,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
