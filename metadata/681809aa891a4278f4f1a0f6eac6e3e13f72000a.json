In the place of national governments, the interplanetary Alliance wields tight political power over inhabitants of the wealthy &quot;central planets&quot;, while life on the partially colonized &quot;Outer Rim&quot; planets resembles the lawlessness and desolation of the American Old West. In the depths of an Alliance facility, Simon Tam rescues his sister River Tam from her scientist captors, who experiment on her with hopes of harnessing her psychic abilities as a weapon. In hiding from the Alliance, the siblings eventually find safe harbor on the spacecraft Serenity, filled with a ragtag crew that makes a living by taking jobs of varying legality in the Outer Rim. After a bank heist on an Outer Rim planet is disrupted by a horde of feral, spacefaring cannibals known as Reavers, the crew narrowly escapes back to Serenity. Simon accosts the ship's captain, Malcolm &quot;Mal&quot; Reynolds, protesting River's involvement in the raid and her exposure to danger, and declares that he and River will leave Serenity at the next spaceport. The crew disembarks at a trading post and enters a bar to meet with Fanty and Mingo, the men who hired Serenity for the robbery. River wanders into the bar and observes a television advertisement in which the Alliance has embedded a subliminal message especially for River. It causes her to immediately and brutally attack the other patrons until Simon arrives and utters a code phrase, which renders River unconscious. Thoroughly confused, Mal takes River and Simon back to Serenity, where Simon reveals that River was conditioned to be an Alliance assassin. Mal contacts Mr. Universe, a reclusive techno-geek who analyzes the bar security camera footage and discovers that a subliminal message in the advertisement triggered River's attack. Unknown to the crew, the message was placed by the Operative, a self-described monster with no name or rank, assigned by the Alliance to retrieve River at all costs.........\n\n\n\n\n\n- Rip Specifications -\n\nDimensione........: 1,468,483,584 byte\nDurata............: 1:54:04\n\nVideo Codec.......: XviD 1.1.0 Final\nVideo Bitrate.....: 1194\nRisoluzione.......: 688 x 288\nFPS (Frames/sec)..: 25.000\nQF (Frame quality): 0.241\n\nTraccia 1\nAudio Codec.......: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3,\nAudio Bitrate.....: 384 CBR,\nCanali audio......: 6,\nFreq Audio........: 48000,\n\nTraccia 2\nAudio Codec.......: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate.....: 128 kb/s Vbr\nCanali audio......: 2\nFreq Audio........: 48000\n\n\n\n\nVisit http://www.tntvillage.scambioetico.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681809aa891a4278f4f1a0f6eac6e3e13f72000a","amp;dn":"Serenity+%5BXvid+-+Ita+Ac3+Eng+Mp3%5D%5BTntvillage.Scambioetico%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681809aa891a4278f4f1a0f6eac6e3e13f72000a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,24,9,170,137,26,66,120,244,241,160,246,234,198,227,225,63,114,0,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
