An array of new, faster and higher-power biophysical methods now enables scientists to examine the mysteries of life at a molecular level. This innovative text surveys and explains the ten key biophysical methods, including those related to biophysical nanotechnology, scanning probe microscopy, X-ray crystallography, ion mobility spectrometry, mass spectrometry, proteomics, and protein folding and structure. Incorporating much information previously unavailable in tutorial form, NÃ¶lting employs worked examples and about 270 illustrations to fully detail the techniques and their underlying mechanisms. Methods in Modern Biophysics is written for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, researchers, lecturers, and professors in biophysics, biochemistry and related fields.\r\n\r\nSpecial features in the 3rd edition: Introduces rapid partial protein ladder sequencing - an important method for fast and highly sensitive identification of proteins, describes the determination of interaction surfaces in protein complexes by mass spectrometric mapping of binding of chemical linkers - a method to support the high-resolution structural analysis of large macromolecular assemblies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efa1bbf285a1911fc6aa5085c94b2d994e84217f","amp;dn":"Methods+in+Modern+Biophysics+2nd+ed+-+Bengt+N%26ouml%3Blting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efa1bbf285a1911fc6aa5085c94b2d994e84217f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,161,187,242,133,161,145,31,198,170,80,133,201,75,45,153,78,132,33,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
