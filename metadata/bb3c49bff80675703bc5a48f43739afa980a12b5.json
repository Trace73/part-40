The days before our parents became strange; before the warming ate away at all the living things in the world; before The Committee and their Blacktroopers. Before the Wall.\n\nLily is a prisoner in her own home. Forced to stay inside by The Committee and guarded by their increasingly distant parents, Lily and her brother Daniel are beginning to ask why. Then, when Daniel disappears just before his seventeenth birthday, Lily knows she is next.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3c49bff80675703bc5a48f43739afa980a12b5","amp;dn":"Days+Like+This+by+Alison+Stewart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3c49bff80675703bc5a48f43739afa980a12b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,60,73,191,248,6,117,112,59,197,164,143,67,115,154,250,152,10,18,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
