The Party's Still Going On\n\nThe Texas-born, Louisiana-raised Marcia Ball has released Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roadhouse AttractionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, her fifth album for Alligator Records, and a celebration of forty years on the road, containing her usual joyous mix of boogie and Gulf Coast blues that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave you with anything less than a smile on your face!\nBased in Austin since 1970 the award-winning pianist / singer / writer is multi-award winning and on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roadside AttractionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ she has delivered a winning 12-track collection, recorded in Nashville and Austin, and produced by Gary Nicholson, who has worked with the likes of Delbert McClinton and Wynonna Judd, and has also co-penned some of the songs.\nThings get off to a trademark start with the rollicking Ã¢â‚¬Å“ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s How It GoesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, which apart from BallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rolling piano and fine vocal, features some tasteful slide guitar from Colin Linden and the great Reese Wynans soloing on Hammond B-3 organ; the swampy title cut of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roadside AttractionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ follows, with LindenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gritty guitar again underpinning more joyous piano work. Marcia BallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Between Here And Kingdom ComeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ slows things down Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a beautiful song and a definite highlight.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“We Fell HardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has a New Orleans feel, with more great piano, and the horns of Dan Bechdolt, Steve Butts and Greg Wilson featured, with some funky grooves from Don Bennett on bass and Damien Llanes on drums. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Look Before You LeapÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a Ã¢â‚¬ËœkillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Texas shuffle, a co-write with the legendary Dan Penn and Gary Nicholson, with some scorching guitar from Mike Schermer, and the whole track swings beautifully.\nThe soulful ballad Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Heard It AllÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a sorrowful tale of a couple having a hotel Ã¢â‚¬ËœdomesticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, with Colin LindenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slide guitar sorrowful here; the Southern soul feel of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Believing In LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ taking things up again, with Reese Wynans featuring again. I could be wrong, but Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Used To Be ParadiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds like a lament for the terrible pollution that was suffered in the Gulf of Mexico, from a personal perspective, with Joel GuzmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sweet accordion giving that authentic Louisiana Cajun edge to the song.\nElsewhere Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sugar BoogieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is pretty self-explanatory, a great swinger with all the band kicking up a storm, as Marcia Ball herself fires off some sparkling piano solos, traded with Mike SchermerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar licks; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mule Headed ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a slow blues, where Ball laments the man in question, who is most definitely stubborn and does his own thing! This highly recommended collection ends on a storming note with the rocking Ã¢â‚¬Å“The PartyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Still Going OnÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ . . . forty years on it certainly is for this much-loved lady of the blues and boogie!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3f9cb6fb953754865c0e7613fbcd1b04b4cb0f","amp;dn":"Marcia+Ball+-+Roadside+Attractions+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3f9cb6fb953754865c0e7613fbcd1b04b4cb0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,63,156,182,251,149,55,84,134,92,14,118,19,251,205,27,4,180,203,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
