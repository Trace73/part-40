As the co-founder, songwriter\nproducer and guitarist of Chic he helped define the sound of the '70s, as\ndisco took the world by storm. Nile and musical partner Bernard Edwards\ncaptured the essence of New York's iconic Studio 54 creating hits like Dance\nDance Dance, Le Freak and Good Times for Chic and We Are Family and Lost\nIn Music for struggling vocal group Sister Sledge. But the music that had\nmade Chic would also break them, thanks to the 'Disco Sucks' backlash. What\ncould have been the end for Nile Rodgers would actually be a new beginning\nas a producer, helping create some of the biggest hits of the 80s for the\nlikes of Diana Ross, David Bowie, Madonna and Duran Duran.\n\nIn this profile documentary, the ever-charismatic Rodgers contributes an\nengaging and often frank interview to tell the tale of how, born to Beatnik\nheroin-addict parents in New York, he picked up a guitar as a teenager and\nembarked on a journey to learn his craft as a musician, before becoming one\nof disco's most successful artists\n\nIn the '70s and '80s he lived the party lifestyle thanks to his success with\nChic and as one of the music industry's hottest producers. Drugs and alcohol\nwould become part of everyday life for Nile, contributing in part to the break\nup of Chic in the early '80s. The band would reform in the mid '90s, but their\nreturn was quickly marked by tragedy with the death of Nile's long-time friend\nand musical partner, Bernard Edwards in 1996.\n\nThen in 2010 Nile was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of prostate\ncancer, which last year he announced he had beaten. In spite of, or perhaps\nbecause of this, Nile's talent and ambition remains undimmed, deservedly earning\nhimself the title of hardest-working man in pop, with Chic's seemingly\ninexhaustible live performance schedule.\n\nNile Rodgers: The Hitmaker recounts a captivating and moving story of a man who\nhas created some of the most sparkling and ebullient pop music ever recorded.\n\nContributors include: Nile Rodgers' fellow Chic members, singers Norma Jean\nAlfa Anderson and Fonzi Thornton and keyboard player Rob Sabino, as well as\nrecording engineers Bob Clearmountain and Robert Drake.\n\nOther artists Nile has worked with talk passionately about his talents,\nincluding Sister Sledge's Kathy Sledge; Bryan Ferry; Steve Winwood; Johnny Marr\nLa Roux's Elly Jackson; Valerie Simpson; Debbie Harry and Chris Stein from\nBlondie and Duran Duran's John Taylor.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/lQRaI.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/lQRaI.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Kd2gH.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/Kd2gH.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/96eQr.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/96eQr.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 641 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 509 Kbps\nDuration 59mn 23s\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\n\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 300 Kbps / 1 300 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.181\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource me.lol\n\n\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 240 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\nSpoken language English\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 06 of April 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:481cadf18e7ba1ca606fcb5e45d7e4d7129603bc","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Nile+Rodgers+The+Hitmaker+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"481cadf18e7ba1ca606fcb5e45d7e4d7129603bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,28,173,241,142,123,161,202,96,111,203,94,69,215,228,215,18,150,3,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
