The audience and crew are in the midst of writing their own story as the event takes place during an actual hurricane in Connecticut. Q&amp;A includes: Can we get rid of the hurricane? Can Shamans and sorcerers really cast evil spells? How can I use my own life story to help others align with their highest excitement? Can Bashar channel his ship into my music composition? How can I transform the loss of my job into something even more exciting? What are the Sassani people learning from us and other beings right now? Are there any chakra points and vortexes here on the East Coast? Hybrid children and being able to conceive a child. Can we each become an ascended master? In how many other parallel realities am I married to my wife? Joseph Campbell and story-telling. Includes a Holotope Experience! \n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nKnowledge is free!\nShare it, seed it, grow it!\n\nMake earth a better place! :)\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55a131b09ab346c33364ad50af995f5733f3e01","amp;dn":"Bashar+-+Writing+Your+Life+Story+%5BPart2%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55a131b09ab346c33364ad50af995f5733f3e01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,90,19,27,9,171,52,108,51,54,74,213,10,249,149,245,115,63,62,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
