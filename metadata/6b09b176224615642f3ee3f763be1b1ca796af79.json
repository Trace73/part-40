But PhilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes were not always on the books or the ball; they were usually looking to the sky.\nPhil grew up with the dream of living the simple life off the land like his forebears, but he soon found himself on a path to self-destructionÃ¢â‚¬â€leasing a bar, drinking too much, fighting, and wasting his talents. He almost lost it all until he gave his life to God. And then everything changed.\nPhilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible story tells how he followed a calling from God and soon after invented a duck call that would begin an incredible journey to the life he had always dreamed of for himself and his family. With great love for his country, his family, and his maker, Phil has finally found the ingredients to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“good lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he always wanted.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b09b176224615642f3ee3f763be1b1ca796af79","amp;dn":"Happy%2C+Happy%2C+Happy+by+Phil+Robertson+%28.ePUB%29%28.MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b09b176224615642f3ee3f763be1b1ca796af79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,9,177,118,34,70,21,100,47,62,227,247,99,190,27,28,167,150,175,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
