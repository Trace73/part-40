It is implied that the title of the manga is derived from the &quot;good endings&quot; that are achieved in harem visual novels. Although the story was once concluded in the one shot version, the full version includes identical characters and settings.\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: Manga Traders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f948fc9c9df8364ad9baa5471c6f374874777705","amp;dn":"GE%3A+Good+Ending+-+Vol.+15","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f948fc9c9df8364ad9baa5471c6f374874777705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,72,252,156,157,248,54,74,217,186,165,71,28,111,55,72,116,119,119,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
