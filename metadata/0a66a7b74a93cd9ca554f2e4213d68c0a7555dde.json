The files in\r\nthe folder &quot;castle&quot; were supposedly for site\r\nsubscribers only, while those in the top level\r\nfolder were free loss leaders.  In general, the\r\ncontent of the castle files was supposed to be\r\nmore intense.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I'm not a fan.  Mr. Daniels technique was\r\nto produce insanely long repetitive flash files\r\nwith dozens of countdowns and content sequences\r\nthat advanced at a glacial pace.  I have read\r\nthat some of the files run for six hours or more,\r\nbut have not had the patience to see for myself.\r\nOn the other hand, some people swear by his methods.\r\n\r\nMr. Daniels always claimed his followers were genetic\r\nwomen whom he was brainwashing into bimbos.  I suspect\r\nthere were as many, or more, men into feminization\r\nwho joined the site.\r\n\r\nIn general a flash file can be played in your web\r\nbrowser, or with Adobe's standalone flash player.\r\nHowever some of these files are node locked, and\r\ncheck whether they are being loaded from\r\nwww.mrdanielshypnosis.com before they will run.\r\nI got around this by creating a dummy web server\r\nand adding that hostname to the &quot;localhost&quot;\r\nentry in the host files.  Other people have said\r\nit is possible to edit the flash files to unlock\r\nthem, but I don't know the tools and methods\r\nused for that.  You may want to run the files\r\non a machine without an internet connection as\r\nsome of them call out to youtube and other sites\r\nin a really anoying way","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a66a7b74a93cd9ca554f2e4213d68c0a7555dde","amp;dn":"Mr.+Daniel%27s+Hypnosis+Study+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a66a7b74a93cd9ca554f2e4213d68c0a7555dde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,102,167,183,74,147,205,156,165,84,242,228,33,61,104,192,167,85,93,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
