It deploys a seemingly inexhaustible repertoire of optical effects, in rendering the experiences of a mental patient wandering outside institutional confines for the first time in many years. Scissere is a film which deliberately eludes verbal categorization or description.\n\nThis film is a work of great complexity, which is perhaps to be expected from a young (24 at the time) ambitious filmmaker. Scissere means to separate, tear to pieces, cleave, divide... in Latin. If one keeps the title in mind, the film gains coherence very early on. A coherence paradoxically based on disconnectedness: rhythmic separation and convergence of sound and image; tectonic shifts operated on the one with regards to the other: decelerating the film, turning &quot;fast frames&quot; into still images, slowing down sound or speech to a monotonous roar, or again animating still photographs, and speeding things up until images become blurred and abstract.\n\nThe elements that make up this film are often banal: a streetcar ride; a run-down neighborhood; a mother talking to her baby; empty hallways; things overheard in passing... And those that could be the basis of a &quot;drama&quot; --  a fire, a robbery -- are anticlimactic... The word &quot;action!&quot; precedes a sequence with a guitarist sitting dazed in his chair, his instrument resting idly in his lap. And yet, that is precisely what the director was aiming for: poetry of the banal. Carefully edited, the film takes the form of a complex mosaic of small elements brought together to suggest, rather than construct, a story: a story made up of rhythms, colors, movements, passages... There is no beginning or end... Scissere as an intersection, an encounter of the lives of strangers in a public place. And whether life makes sense, that depends on the viewer.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/1853/vlcsnap1427757.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/1853/vlcsnap1427757.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8927/vlcsnap1429011.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img100.imageshack.us/img100/8927/vlcsnap1429011.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img381.imageshack.us/img381/9788/vlcsnap1432155.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img381.imageshack.us/img381/9788/vlcsnap1432155.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img172.imageshack.us/img172/2899/vlcsnap1440667.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img172.imageshack.us/img172/2899/vlcsnap1440667.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---------not my rip-------\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,049,391,104 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:26:27\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 544x416 (AR: 1.308)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1420 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.262 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1 \n\n*************************\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
