Consequently, his shares of the corporation must be sold publicly. To the dismay of the board of directors, this means that more than half the company will be owned by outsiders.\n  Corporate executive, Sidney Mussberger (Paul Newman), devises a fiendish scheme to devalue the shares of the corporation. He will simply hire a numbskull as the new CEO in order to drive the company temporarily into the ground, causing the value of the shares to plummet. The board of directors can then afford to buy the outstanding shares floating out there at rock bottom prices, retaining control of the corporation.\n  Sidney selects Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), a dopey, but nice guy,  who works in the company mailroom. Barnes happens to have an idea that he has been working on for years. When he shows a picture of a circle as representative of his idea, the viewer wonders just what the heck is so special about it. So does Sidney, who allows Barnes to execute his idea, believing him to be a total moron whose idea is just the thing to make the companies stock tank.\n\n  Starring: Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Newman, Charles Durning, John Mahoney.\n\n  Directed by: Joel Coen, Ethan Coen.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 51min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da012f1eff3f53ad738d41c6c7d2a73f6fb6793d","amp;dn":"The+Hudsucker+Proxy+%281994%29+%28Tim+Robbins%2C+Jennifer+Jason+Leigh%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da012f1eff3f53ad738d41c6c7d2a73f6fb6793d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,1,47,30,255,63,83,173,115,141,65,198,199,210,167,63,111,182,121,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
