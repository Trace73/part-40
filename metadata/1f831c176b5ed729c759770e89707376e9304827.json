Of them Castalia is the most inventive and musically complex, Tibet is the quiet one, and &quot;Mark Isham&quot; has the best &quot;songs&quot;. Tibet was originally music for a laser disk &quot;movie&quot; and as a result it is not surprising that it is quieter than the others. However, it is a subtle record of great beauty and unpredictability. \n\nI love it when the slow synth &quot;washes&quot; are suddenly interupted by the wierd guitar and horn duets (as happens in part II). The spoken haikus also just appear out of nowhere and are then followed mysteriously by a complex two minute segment of horns, guitar and percussion (David Torn on guitar, Kurt Wortman on percussion) as happens at the end of part III.\n\nTo me, this is a perfect record for thinking, for contemplating the world, to lose myself in thought.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f831c176b5ed729c759770e89707376e9304827","amp;dn":"Mark+Isham+-+Tibet+%28New+Age%2C+1989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f831c176b5ed729c759770e89707376e9304827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,131,28,23,107,94,215,41,199,89,119,14,137,112,115,118,233,48,72,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
