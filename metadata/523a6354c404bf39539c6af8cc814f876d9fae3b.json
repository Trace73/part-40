Though this gift once made her valuable to the police, the cops have shunned her since a tragic turn of events cost innocent people their lives.\nThen dead bodies started piling up, a bizarre symbol on their foreheads. Soon, whispers of the Nothingman could be heard on the rain-slicked streets of the city, prompting a tabloid writer to lure Sarah out of retirement to stop a madman.\nGuide Sarah through a classic noir adventure as she searches for clues, solves puzzles and learns to use new visions that appear to be helping her. The Gift will transport you through a town steeped in neon glow, challenge you with cunning mini-games and surprise you with cleverly hidden objects. From the music, to the visuals, to the voice work, The Gift is an unforgettable cross between a moody '40s detective movie and a modern occult thriller.\nCan you bring the killer to justice and restore Sarah's name? Lives are depending on it!\n\nGame Features:\n46 locations\n18 mini-games\n20 hidden object scenes\nLearn-as-you-play tutorial\nUnlimited hints and tips\n\nTHANKS TO VELOCITY\n\n\nextract and play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:523a6354c404bf39539c6af8cc814f876d9fae3b","amp;dn":"The+Gift","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"523a6354c404bf39539c6af8cc814f876d9fae3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,58,99,84,196,4,191,57,83,156,106,248,204,129,79,135,109,159,174,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
