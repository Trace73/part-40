The sole survivor of the accident killed the absentee crew members and warned the town never to have another Valentine's Day celebration. When a group of teenagers decides that the the town has gone without a party long enough and begin planning one, a murderous maniac in mining gear begins dispatching townsfolk in bloody and creative ways. Combining the small town atmosphere of HALLOWEEN (1978) with the body count gore of FRIDAY THE 13TH (1980), MY BLOODY VALENTINE is an example of the glut of low-budget copycat films that those two influential films inspired in the early 1980s.\n\nCredits \nCast: Lori Hallier, Neil Affleck, Paul Kelman \nDirector: George Mihalka \nProducer: Andre Link, Bob Presner, John Dunning \n\nSynopsis\nA mad coal miner, lurking in the shadows of a town called Valentine Bluffs, goes on a rampage and gruesomely slays as many of the local teenagers as he can. Blood fills the air, as the crazed killer buries his trusty pick-axe in one kid after another.... Stay, little Valentine, stay....\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05aca8089551eadf8451dde2fa48b1e227a7db04","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine-Uncut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05aca8089551eadf8451dde2fa48b1e227a7db04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,172,168,8,149,81,234,223,132,81,221,226,250,72,177,226,39,167,219,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
