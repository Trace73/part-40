In 1947, Visconti went to Sicily, with a small amount of capital advanced by the Communist Party, to make what was initially to have been a short documentary. He stayed there for six months, and the project gradually expanded in scale until what was proposed became a mammoth epic on the conditions of the poor workers and peasants and their struggle to liberate themselves from oppression.\n\n\nRipley's Home Video","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0e3656a33802cff85954b5b56768673a9af8149","amp;dn":"La+terra+trema+-+Luchino+Visconti","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0e3656a33802cff85954b5b56768673a9af8149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,227,101,106,51,128,44,255,133,149,75,91,86,118,134,115,169,175,129,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
