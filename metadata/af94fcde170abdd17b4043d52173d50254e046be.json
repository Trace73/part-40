And this expression includes even the older medieval flavours. It is very much done with an acid folk strength. \n\nInstruments like cello, acoustic and electric guitars but also santur, tympani, and lesser known string instruments reveals the magic in the songs, beside HelenaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sweet singing fits with this approach very beautifully. Also Masaki Batoh sings twice, and in duet. \n\nThe last track, the longest improvisation, includes also more percussive instruments and features a few other members from Ghost.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af94fcde170abdd17b4043d52173d50254e046be","amp;dn":"Helena+Espvall+%26+Masaki+Batoh...Helena+Espvall+%26+Masaki+Batoh%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af94fcde170abdd17b4043d52173d50254e046be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,148,252,222,23,10,189,209,123,64,67,213,33,115,213,2,84,224,70,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
