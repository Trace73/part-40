That comes as a shockÃ¢â‚¬â€I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aware that they had started legislating. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not split hairs, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just say that Congress is done even pretending to legislate this year. The House is scheduled to be in session for only 7 days in November and 8 days in December. The only work that gets done in the House is when the cleaning crew comes in and dusts the seats of the members.\n\nThe United States is doing better than most people realize. As Eugene Robinson points out, the economy is growing, the stock market is at all-time highs, and the budget deficit has been slashed dramatically. We still have some serious problems in this countryÃ¢â‚¬â€but more than a few of them are intentionally caused by a Republican Congress. We have a cure for that, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called an Ã¢â‚¬Å“election.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThe good news is that weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re better off than you think. The bad news is that Republican designs are more nefarious than you know. With gerrymandering, obstructionism, and voter suppression, the Republicans have rigged the game. They can win close games by cheating but at a certain point they can only continue to win by cheating if they rewrite the rules of the game to allow their cheating. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what Citizens United was all about.\n\nA group funded by the Koch brothers is throwing booze-filled tailgate parties at campuses to convince young people not to sign up for health insurance. Really. It sounds like they stole the idea from a story in the Onion. This is what the Koch brothers do with their billionsÃ¢â‚¬â€try to gradually destroy decent society. Why donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they just poison the water supply and get it over with?\n\nA white supremacist who is trying to turn a small North Dakota town into a white enclave has undergone a DNA test showing him to be part black. I guess he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live in his own town now. Or maybe he can live right on the border line. The DNA test showed that white supremacist Craig Cobb is 14 percent sub-Saharan African, or what most people just call Ã¢â‚¬Å“blackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and what people like Craig Cobb call a whole bunch of other names.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bafb8eec649e25d2a1408354b8c0459962a019d","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+November+12+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bafb8eec649e25d2a1408354b8c0459962a019d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,175,184,238,198,73,226,93,42,20,8,53,75,140,4,89,150,42,1,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
