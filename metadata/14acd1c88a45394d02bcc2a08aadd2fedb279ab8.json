The mysterious Dr. Z has enlisted three space heroes to search the galaxy for the fabled Twelve Gems of Power: the hulking alien-brawn Furz; the beautiful and deadly sabre-wielding Venus; and the soft-spoken canine technician, Dogstar. They meet many strange and storied characters on their journey, but none so strange or sinister as their dear benefactor himself. With a heavy dose of humor and wall-to-wall action, this is one of the most action-packed and funny books of the year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14acd1c88a45394d02bcc2a08aadd2fedb279ab8","amp;dn":"Twelve+Gems+%282014%29+%28digital%29+%28Minutemen-InnerDemons%29.cbr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14acd1c88a45394d02bcc2a08aadd2fedb279ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,172,209,200,138,69,57,77,2,188,194,160,138,173,210,254,219,39,154,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
