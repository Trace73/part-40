They were being chased by S.H.I.E.L.D,\nusing information given by an incapacitated and incarcerated Miek to Shield Agent Kate Waynesboro. Trapped inside Gammaworld, the Warbound joined forces with a local\nUS Army company to save a nearby town from irradiated (and thus huge) insects, and began to feel the effects of the gamma radiation themselves.\nUsing Hiroim's Oldstrong power, the group managed to dispel some of the radiation, opening a gap in the Gammaworld dome through which the civilians could escape.\nHowever, they were interrupted by the arrival of a huge, gamma-powered gestalt being composed of numerous townsfolk and a dog fused together by the radiation.\nThe creature, known as Horde, attempted to destroy everyone who tried to leave, but was fended off by Agent Waynesboro. As the Warbound attacked the Leader,\nHiroim told Korg to kill him in order to destroy the dome. Korg shattered Hiroim and the dome dissipated; however Hiroim reformed, as did the dome.\nThe group were then attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D. sentry robots, which had been placed under the Leader's control. In the ensuing battle, Elloe stabbed the Leader in the chest.\nThe Leader then absorbed the Dome's power, turning into a gray skinned giant. Hiroim stopped him, killing himself in the process. Before dying, he passed on his\nOldstrong power to Kate, who protected the remaining people from an attacking monster.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d12a7962fb00f44a5ff6c19800b3dec5bcaf387","amp;dn":"WORLD+WAR+HULK+-+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d12a7962fb00f44a5ff6c19800b3dec5bcaf387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,18,167,150,47,176,15,68,165,255,108,25,128,11,61,236,91,202,243,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
