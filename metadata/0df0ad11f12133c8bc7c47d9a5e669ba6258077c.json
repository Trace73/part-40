Jackson also featured as a vocalist on the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot;, written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. After a publicity photo shoot, in which an animatronic robot of E.T. hugged Jackson, the singer stated &quot;he was so real that I was talking to him. I kissed him before I left. The next day, I missed him.&quot;\n\nJackson's record label, Epic, allowed the singer to record the album for MCA on two conditions:\n\n1. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was not to be released until after Christmas 1982. This was to avoid the audiobook competing with Jackson's new album, Thriller.\n2. &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot; was not to be released as a single.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0df0ad11f12133c8bc7c47d9a5e669ba6258077c","amp;dn":"MICHAEL+JACKSON+-+E.T.+Theme+Song+and+Picture","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0df0ad11f12133c8bc7c47d9a5e669ba6258077c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,240,173,17,241,33,51,200,188,124,71,217,165,230,105,186,98,88,7,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
