I did all the work for you so that you have only two steps now instead of about 15. It's open the folder, and paste the sound folder to your data folder. Much easier.. I have more detailed instructions (if need be...) in the download in a text file. This enabled all important sound and dialogue to appear during the main quest while talking to Esbern in the ratways. Hope this helps, be sure to comment and seed! \n\n                                  Thanks, David R.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff786edfb75015d11c46dad75022f1f5384c7c82","amp;dn":"UPDATE+-+Skyrim+Esbern+Fix+PC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff786edfb75015d11c46dad75022f1f5384c7c82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,120,110,223,183,80,21,209,28,70,218,215,80,34,241,245,56,76,124,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
