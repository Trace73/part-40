The first part of his career, chaloff starred with woody herman's second herd - the junkie band - and was notorious as a ringleader - many held him responsible for the death of trumpeter sonny berman - musically, however, chaloff was untouchable and was #1 in jazz polls - after herman's band shut down, chaloff went back to boston - it took about five years for him to kick his habit. Cleaned up, more mature, he began playing at a whole new level - this album, recorded with a trio he'd never played with before, is amazing - every tune is terrific, on a technical level, you will probably never hear the baritone saxophone played better - like a mack truck doing wheelies. Capitol has re-released this classic album - and everyone I've played it for adds it to their favorite jazz album collection. Shortly after it was recorded, Chaloff became ill - he died in 1957 at the age of 33. Another reviewer wrote, &quot;the rapport of the group is still astonishing. The net effect is of every note being in place, flawlessly executed, as if even the slightest nuance were carefully chosen for maximum aesthetic impact. This is a level of achievement beyond the aspirations of all but the masters, and from an ensemble that was not even a working group, takes on an aura of the miraculous. Such achievements are rare in any medium.&quot; Check it out. ~Bruce Bendinger\n\n01. A Handful Of Stars\n02. The Goof And I\n03. Thanks For The Memory\n04. All The Things You Are\n05.
