It is a very 80's movie with\nold macintoshes, nerds and the world view of technology\nand computers being very 80's in a fun way. Because\nI didn't find any existing torrents or DVD version on\nsale for this I decided to rip the old TV recording I\nstill had on a VHS tape. Picture and audio quality is\nas good as was possible -- remember it is an old analog\nTV recording after all. There are also finnish subtitles\nincluded as hard sub, but if you don't know finnish you\ncan try to ignore them because the audio is original\nenglish.\n\n&quot;Henry Crawford is the titular absent-minded professor\nbusy at work in his laboratory. He has a girlfriend, but\nshe is getting frustrated at his repeatedly missing their\ndates and spending more time with his experiments than\nwith her. One day, Prof. Crawford makes an incredible\ndiscovery a form of rubber that defies gravity with each\nbounce, which he names Flubber. Hopefully, with this\ninvention Crawford can prove to his love that he's not\njust a hopeless loser stuck doing dead-end research.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da4ab4d4c9f80784b10653036236e82c65d65da8","amp;dn":"The+Absent-Minded+Professor+1988+Disney+%5BYhteiso%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da4ab4d4c9f80784b10653036236e82c65d65da8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,74,180,212,201,248,7,132,177,6,83,3,98,54,232,44,101,214,93,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
