The film's central figure is a young boy named Fando, who lives with his mother. \nHis father has been arrested during the Spanish Civil War. Fando later finds a letter and discovers his mother turned his father in to the authorities. This triggers off the many fantasy sequences of Fando. Arrabal uses grainy filtered footage during these sequences and gives them several different colours. The film is full of frenzy. It was created by someone with a furious imagination. The bull slaughter scene is a masterful surrealist sequence. It is a remarkable film and essential viewing for anyone interested in surrealism!\n\nenglish subtitle\n\nI HAVE A LOT OF WIERD MOVIES BUT IÃ‚Â´M ONLY GOING TO UPPLOAD THEM IF YOU DOWNLOADERS SEEDING THEM! \n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE! \n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n[thanks to cor for that] \n\n\nMy movies so far: \nFando y Lis \nThe holy mountain \nEl topo \nSanta Sangre \nUzumaki \nThe happiness of the katakuris \nSession 9 \nThe great silence \nFAUST \nAn Andalusian Dog \nThe Rainbow thief \nGlen or Glenda \nALICE \nThe Exterminating Angel\nViva la muerte \nBride of the monster\nThe Nine Lives of Tomas Katz \nConspirators of Pleasure \nBEGOTTEN\n\nDo you like really fucked-up, weird flicks?
