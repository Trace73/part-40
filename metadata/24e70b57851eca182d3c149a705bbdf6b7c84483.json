With just a screen of text and a prompt,           \n          you would be asked the simple question: What              \n            do you want to do next?                                     \n                                                                      \n            As you typed in commands and sentences, the             \n             games would tell you a story; a story fraught                \n               with danger, excitement, puzzles and hours of                  \n               exploration. Victory would seem just around                    \n               the next corner or through the next barrier.                   \n                                                                              \n                 Players could spend hours, weeks or months                   \n               immersed in these games, testing their thinking                \n               skills to the limit and sharing their victories                \n               and defeats.                                                   \n                                                                              \n                 They were called text adventures, adventure                  \n               games, and interactive ficiton. They dominated                 \n               the sales charts and introduced millions to                    \n               the power and flexibility of home computers. No                \n               other type of computer game could come close.                  \n                                                                              \n                 And then they were gone forever.                             \n                                                                              \n                 Or maybe they never actually left.                           \n                                                                              \n                 Director Jason Scott interviewed dozens of                   \n               creators, players, and scholard about the                      \n               experience and effect of text adventures and                   \n               interactive fiction.

Usenet, Gopher,                \n               Archie, none could measure up to the popularity                \n               of the BBS.                                                    \n                                                                              \n                 Why then, he asked himself, hasn't anyone made               \n               any documentaries about this phenomenon, that                  \n               meant so much to so many? Rather than being all                \n               rhetorical about it, he simply decided to make                 \n               it himself! Without funding, without experience,               \n               without help (for the most part), he made a full               \n               8 episode boxset documentary, the most awesome                 \n               retelling of the history of the BBS that the world             \n               is ever likely to encounter. Better yet, being                 \n               a pirate at heart, he licensed it as Creative                  \n               Commons, making it fully legal for anyone to                   \n               download and share as they please. Did I mention               \n               he's awesome?                                                  \n                                                                              \n                 Now he's back, and what better subject to                    \n               tackle for someone who breathes ASCII than the                 \n               text adventure game! An artform largely forgotten              \n               today, the text adventure grew out of what so                  \n               many games lack today; wanting to inspire your                 \n               free imagination. No 3D engine arms race, no                   \n               lauding of physics or realism, just a storyline,               \n               some words, and a whole lot of creativity.                     \n               Complex worlds that would fit in the memory                    \n               today available in your wrist watch.                           \n                                                                              \n                 As is common with Jason Scott releases, the                  \n               DVD is packed with extras, yet we've chosen to                 \n               include none of them. Why? Because he deserves                 \n               your money, that's why! Because there's no greedy              \n               corporation behind this, no corrupt distributor,               \n               no MPAA no nothing. Because this guy curses                    \n               digital data lobotomy as much as you do, because               \n               he *let* you download this film, because we wanna              \n          see what he's able to do next. If you only buy a          \n           single DVD this year, let it be this one.                  \n                                                                          \n             Enjoy!                                                       \n                                                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                  \n                                                                        \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                                                                  \n                                                \n                                                      \n                      -+ Who We Are +-                       \n                                                                        \n                                                                        \n            Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to pres-             \n           erving the neglected titles of an entertainment              \n            era long gone. A time of classic kids flicks,                 \n          painstaking hand-drawn animation and countless              \n             cheesy low-budget horrors. A time when pop had                 \n              a King, and rock had a Queen. A time when special               \n              FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of their                 \n              many tools.                                                     \n                                                                              \n                Driven by nostalgia and memories of better                    \n              days, we seek to relive those times, and share                  \n              those memories. While our belief is that the                    \n              80s represent the very pinnacle of pop culture,                 \n              we will not limit ourselves to one decade, or                   \n              any single genre.

We will not disregard a timepiece                  \n              just because it is dated.                                       \n                                                                              \n                Whereas most groups rely solely on digital                    \n              sources, there are still thousands of rare and                  \n              out of print titles, many of which have no                      \n              planned digital release.
