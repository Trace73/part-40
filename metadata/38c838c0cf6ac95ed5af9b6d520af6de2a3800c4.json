A century later, acts of man, nature, and history converge on that same forbidding shore with a power sufficient to shatter civilization as we know it.\n\nArmy epidemiologist Frank Slater is facing a court-martial, but after his punishment is mysteriously lifted, Slater is offered a job no one else wants--to travel to a small island off the coast of Alaska and investigate a potentially lethal phenomenon: The permafrost has begun to melt, exposing bodies from a colony that was wiped out by the dreaded Spanish flu of 1918. Frank must determine if the thawed remains still carry the deadly virus in their frozen flesh and, if so, ensure that it doesn't come back to life.\n\nFrank and his handpicked team arrive by helicopter, loaded down with high-tech tools, prepared to exhume history. The colony, it transpires, was once settled by a sect devoted to the mad Russian monk Rasputin, but there is even more hiding in the past than FrankÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team is aware of. Any hope of success hinges on their willingness to accept the fact that even their cutting-edge science has its limitsÃ¢â‚¬â€and that the ancient wisdom of the Inuit people who once inhabited this eerie land is as essential as any serum. By the time Frank discovers that his mission has been compromisedÃ¢â‚¬â€crashed by a gang of reckless treasure huntersÃ¢â‚¬â€he will be in a brutal race against time. With a young, strong-willed Inuit woman by his side, Frank must put a deadly genie back in the bottle before all of humanity pays the price.\n\nThe Romanov Cross is at once an alternate take on one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most profound mysteries, a love story as unlikely as it is inevitable, and a thriller of heart-stopping, supernatural suspense. With his signature blend of fascinating history and fantastic imagination, critically acclaimed author Robert Masello has once again crafted a terrifying story of past events coming back to haunt the present day . . . and of dark deeds aching to be unearthed.\n\nFor Requests &amp; to view My New Releases  - \nPlease visit My Release Thread.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/Thread-Rose88-My-Book-Uploads&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThank You.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c838c0cf6ac95ed5af9b6d520af6de2a3800c4","amp;dn":"+The+Romanov+Cross+by+Robert+Masello+%28Retail+-+Request%29+%7BRose88%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c838c0cf6ac95ed5af9b6d520af6de2a3800c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,200,56,192,207,106,201,94,213,175,155,109,82,10,246,222,42,56,0,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
