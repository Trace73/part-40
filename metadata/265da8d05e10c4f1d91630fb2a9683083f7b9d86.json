Her world takes a turn for the better when Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a disgraced record-label exec, stumbles upon her performing on an East Village stage and is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter emerges an enchanting portrait of a mutually transformative collaboration, set to the soundtrack of a summer in New York City.\n\n\n\nPLEASE SEED...\n\nCheck For More.... @sunmoonbd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:265da8d05e10c4f1d91630fb2a9683083f7b9d86","amp;dn":"Begin+Again+%282013%29+275MB+BRRip+480P+English+ESubs-sunmoonbd.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"265da8d05e10c4f1d91630fb2a9683083f7b9d86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,93,168,208,94,16,196,241,217,22,48,251,42,150,131,8,63,123,157,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
