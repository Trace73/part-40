Unlike their husbands and brothers, women in the Southwest did not, for the most part, subdue and tame the land; but their character and individuality were manifested as they lived with and improved upon conditions as they found them. Their fascination with their way of life and the need for self-expression led them to write of their experiences, providing them with a creative outlet and offering those who came later a unique window into the past.\n\nThe trials and excitement of pioneer life and survival are portrayed in these personal accounts by 15 diverse women (e.g., an artist, Mormon wife, homesteader, rodeo rider, and Native American) who lived in the unsettled Southwest primarily in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The events in these women's lives are told through their oral histories, diaries, etc. Their varied writing styles vividly portray their daily struggles in a rugged environment, as well as their newly discovered sense of personal freedom. A celebration of some unconventional women and an important view of the Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado frontier. Highly recommended for women's studies collections.
