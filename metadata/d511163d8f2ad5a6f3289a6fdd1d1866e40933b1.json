Not all film sound tracks are worth buying, but this one is. The music from Luc Besson's film &quot;The Big Blue&quot; is wonderful, haunting, melodic and very soothing. \r\nNo hard rock, rap or pop for you on this CD but that in itself is a welcome change. You feel like you are floating in a sea of musical waves whilst swimming with dolphins. Each time I play this CD I remember the awesome scene in the film where the central character Jacques is lying in his bed watching the sea above him slowly lower itself to his reach. Is he dreaming you ask yourself as the music pounds in your ears, or is it reality? I loved the film and I equally love the music that accompanied it. \r\nEven if you don't get to see the film, the music stands on its own, and you can't go wrong with the price either. Well worth adding to your CD collection if you want something thought provoking and little different from the norm.
