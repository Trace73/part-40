In addition \nto directing, Clint Eastwood provides what may be his most \nbeautiful, touching and compelling score. Clint Eastwood directs \nAngelina Jolie and John Malkovich in a provocative thriller based \non actual events: Changeling. In the film, Christine Collins' \n(Jolie) prayers are met when her kidnapped son is returned. But \namidst the frenzy of the photo op reunion, she realizes this child \nis not hers. Facing corrupt police and a skeptical public, she \ndesperately hunts for answers,only to be confronted by a truth \nthat will change her forever.\n\nimdb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0824747/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc001e26669c76bf7c1f6d0fe59ba3a6ea238be","amp;dn":"Clint+Eastwood-Changeling-%28OST%29-2008-EON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc001e26669c76bf7c1f6d0fe59ba3a6ea238be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,192,1,226,102,105,199,107,247,193,246,208,254,89,186,58,110,162,56,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
