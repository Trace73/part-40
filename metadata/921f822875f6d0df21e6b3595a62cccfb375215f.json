Covering a time span of 26,000 years, it long predates the information of the bible and it is the representation of one cycle of the earth - the beginning and ending of time as the ancients understood it and how it was encoded in the astrological circle. New World Bible provides an alternative historical account not only for the current generation but for generations to come. 210 pages. A must read for everyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:921f822875f6d0df21e6b3595a62cccfb375215f","amp;dn":"Levon+-+New+World+Bible+-+The+Story+of+the+Truth+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"921f822875f6d0df21e6b3595a62cccfb375215f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,31,130,40,117,246,208,223,33,230,179,89,90,98,204,207,179,117,33,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
