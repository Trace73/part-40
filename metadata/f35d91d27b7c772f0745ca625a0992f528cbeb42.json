It's simple to use, fast, reliable, and most people who have used it can't say differently.\n\nPowerISO lets you manipulate CD and DVD image files, by creating, adjusting, converting, and mounting their contents.\n\nRight after installation is complete, you can choose file associations (PowerISO supports most of them), and the number of virtual drives (from none to 23). Don't worry, you can change this information afterward. System restart is necessary.\n\nThe interface is extremely easy to use, whether you have worked with burning tools before or not.\n\nIn the Tools section you can copy CD, DVD or BD discs, create and burn floppy disk images, USB drive images, bootable USB drives, audio CDs, erase rewritable discs, or mount images.\n\nBlu-ray disc burning is also supported by PowerISO, and you can test files, as well as convert and compress content.\n\nIf you experience any issues in using PowerISO, you can browse the help file. Fortunately, you don't need an internet connection for it.\n\nCPU and memory usage is low when there are no active tasks, but it considerably rises otherwise.\n\nThe time it takes PowerISO to burn discs is excellent, but you can save content only in three image file formats (DAA, ISO and BIN) in the trial version. The price of the full version is reasonable (the same as for other similar products).\n\nSo, if you are looking for a complete burning experience for your discs, PowerISO might just do the trick.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;PowerISO [ DISCOUNT: 67% OFF! ]&quot;:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Support almost all CD/DVD-ROM image file formats(ISO, BIN, NRG, CDI, DAA and so on).\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Note: DAA(Direct-Access-Archive) is an advanced format for image file, which supports some advanced features, such as compression, password protection, and splitting to multiple volumes. It can be handled directly just like other formats, such as ISO, BIN, ...\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n@@@ Requirement @@@\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Note: The internal virtual drive needs Windows2000/XP/2003 or above.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Intel Pentium 166MHz or above.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· 64MB memory.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· At least 10MB hard disk space.\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n\n@@@ ScreenShot @@@\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/961/33685674.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/961/33685674.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n===================================================================================\n===================================================================================\n\n\n@@@ Inside RAR File @@@\n\n\n\n1.
