(Which I would have called Pack 31 but my lack of research, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a huge web, would create some conflict, so IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work by year).  It might be pretty obvious for the titles in this Pack, that the Avengers and X-MenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worlds are beginning to merge.  Who knows how long this will last?  WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had The Civil War, The Skrull Invasion, The House of M, and now AvX.  Heck after AvX Wanda and the Mutants are back.  Is this a second chance to make a first impression?  This Pack includes the event I have been really excited about: Avengers vs. X-Men.  When trying to decide on a reading order I found this at Phil The Comic GuyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blog:   I tried it, and I think he did an excellent job, as he has an excellent blog.\n\nI am a big fan of the previous Chrono-packs and really enjoy reading runs of comics rather than as they come out month by month.  I have gone with the highest rez, best looking versions of each issue that I could come up with. \n \nMy ground rules for inclusion are pretty broad.  I am trying to follow all of the mutants that we know and love where ever they appear.  So for instance if Wolverine, Storm, or the Beast are in an Avengers title, I include it, but if no mutants are included in a storyline at all I probably exclude it.  I consider Deadpool to be part of the mutant family, so you will see his stuff here also.  I think the orders here work pretty well, but you can reorder stuff as you see fit.  If anyone has suggestions of issues I might have missed let me know.  I will try to work them in.\n\nPrevious packs can be found hosted at kick ass torrents.  A place to start would be http://ka.tt/mangaphile-s-chronological-x-men-pack-19-t6590819.html\n\nThese are not my scans.  I have been in awe of the folks that turn out such amazing scans and you will find most scans are tagged by their makers.   Let us hope that the sharing continues.\nThese issues are from the Marvel Universe with various authors and illustrators.\n\nIssues are all from 2011-12\n\nThe format of all the files is either .cbr or .cbz and the language is ENGLISH\n\nHere are the specific issues to found herein:\n\nAvengers The Childrens Crusade 1-9 + Young Avengers\nAge of Apocalypse 1-6\nPoint One 1\nAvengers  X-Sanction 1-4\nWolverine 310-312\nNew Mutants 47-50\nX-Men 36-37\nX-Factor 245\nPreliminary Reading\n000 Marvel Point One #0\n001 Avengers X-Sanction #1\n002 Avengers X-Sanction #2\n003 Avengers X-Sanction #3\n004 Avengers X-Sanction #4\n005 Avengers #24.1\nRounds 0-2: The Appearance of the Phoenix\n006 Avengers vs. X-Men #0\n007 Avengers vs. X-Men #1\n008 Wolverine and the X-Men #9\n009 New Avengers #24\n010 Avengers vs. X-Men #2\n011 Avengers #25\n012 AvX: Versus #1 (Iron Man vs. Magneto; The Thing vs. Namor)\n013 Uncanny X-Men #11\nRound 3: The Separation of Powers and Prisoners of War\n014 Avengers vs. X-Men #3\n015 Avengers Academy # 29\n016 Avengers Academy #30\n017 Avengers Academy #31\n018 Wolverine and the X-Men #10\n019 X-Men Legacy #266\n020 X-Men Legacy #267\nInterlude I: Fighting the Phoenix in Deep Space\n021 Secret Avengers #26\n022 Secret Avengers #27\n023 Secret Avengers #28 \n024 Avengers #26\n025 Avengers #27\nRound 4: The Search for Hope\n026 Avengers vs. X-Men #4\n027 AvX: Versus #5 (Hawkeye vs Angel; Black Panther vs Storm) \n028 AvX: Versus #2 (Captain America vs. Gambit; Spider-Man vs. Colossus)\n029 Uncanny X-Men #12\n030 Wolverine and the X-Men #11\nRound 5: The Phoenix is Now Five\n031 Avengers vs. X-Men #5\n032 Uncanny X-Men #13\n033 AvX: Versus #3 (The Thing Vs.
