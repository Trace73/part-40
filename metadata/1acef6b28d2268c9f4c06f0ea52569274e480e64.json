Overall, the entire work possesses an edgy Beat-like quality. \r\nOn &quot;Empire,&quot; an emotive ballad that plays with the similarity between the words &quot;empire&quot; and &quot;vampire&quot; to describe England as a bloodsucking entity, Sinead O'Connor duets with the delicate vocals of newcomer Benjamin Zephaniah to beautiful effect. \r\nReggae legend Bim Sherman offers the gentle &quot;Sleepyhead.&quot; But it's Los Angeles-based wordsmith Justin Warfield that is most responsible for Clear's sharp punch, waxing lyrical about Willy Wonka over Simenon's drug-addled oboe soundtrack on &quot;Brain Dead&quot; and flipping silver-tongued lines on the single &quot;Bug Powder Dust.&quot; (Amazon)\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Bomb the Bass' third album, Clear, was originally a scattershot, kinetic dance record, Tim Simenon restructured the record for its American release. The American version of Clear demonstrates a distinct trip-hop, techno, jazz, and dub influence, as well as the literary lyical pretentions that were present on the original English release. Simenon created a subdued, multi-layered album, where instruments float in and out of the mix over a deep, laidback groove. All of the rappers on the record are guest stars, including Sinead O'Connor and Justin Warfield. Although their contributions are impressive, the true star of the album is Simenon, who has made an album that proves he isn't stuck in the late-'80s house/techno rut and can compete with '90s artists like Tricky and Portishead. Still, the album highlight comes with a La Funk Mob reworking. (AMG)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/BpivdTT.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01. Bug Powder Dust (With Justin Warfield)    [4:18]\r\n02.
