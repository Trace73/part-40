Co-produced by The Open University, Berlin is a new three-part documentary written and presented by award-winning, German-born, journalist Matt Frei, who unveils the turbulent and dramatic story of this city from the Prussian years right through to the fall of the Berlin Wall.\n\n\n\n2)  Ruined Visions \nThe story of Berlin and its buildings is one of visionary creation and terrible destruction, of human ambition and delusion. From the 19th-century architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel to the Bauhaus pioneers of Modernism and the rebuilding of the city after the fall of the Wall, it is a city that has always looked to the future.\nArchitect Albert Speer had grand plans to transform Berlin into a monumental Nazi capital for Adolf Hitler, and the buildings that remain from his scheme are still haunted by their terrible associations.\nThere is no other city in the world where the morality of the architecture has been so heavily scrutinized. Buildings with Imperial, Nazi and Communist pasts all inspire fierce debates about whether this city should acknowledge or deny its chequered history.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3824/mattfreisberlinscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/3824/mattfreisberlinscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1329/mattfreisberlinscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1329/mattfreisberlinscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3612/mattfreisberlinscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img811.imageshack.us/img811/3612/mattfreisberlinscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9011/mattfreisberlinscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9011/mattfreisberlinscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/779/mattfreisberlinscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img849.imageshack.us/img849/779/mattfreisberlinscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6856/mattfreisberlinscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img109.imageshack.us/img109/6856/mattfreisberlinscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD\n * Video Bitrate: 1584 KB/s\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1:76\n * Video Resolution: 704 x 400\n * Audio Codec: (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s 48000Hz\n * Run-Time: 59mins\n * Framerate: 25FPS\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 746mb/s\n * Ripped by artistharry\n * Subtitles: English\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83cd9a010558f3ab359455d3fc2a20d1cfe48d1d","amp;dn":"BBC+Matt+Freis+Berlin+2of3+Ruined+Visions+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83cd9a010558f3ab359455d3fc2a20d1cfe48d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,205,154,1,5,88,243,171,53,148,85,211,252,42,32,209,207,228,141,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
