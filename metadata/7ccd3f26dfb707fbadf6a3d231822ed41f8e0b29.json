Beaver, James C. Barnes &amp; Brian B. Boutwell.pdf\n\nThe Nurture Versus Biosocial Debate in Criminology: On the Origins of Criminal Behavior and Criminality takes a contemporary approach to address the sociological and the biological positions of human behavior by allowing preeminent scholars in criminology to speak to the effects of each on a range of topics. Kevin M. Beaver, J.C. Barnes, and Brian B. Boutwell aim to facilitate an open and honest debate between the more traditional criminologists who focus primarily on environmental factors and contemporary biosocial criminologists who examine the interplay between biology/genetics and environmental factors.\n\n472 pages\nPublisher: SAGE Publications, Inc; 1 edition (February 10, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1452242259\nISBN-13: 978-1452242255","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccd3f26dfb707fbadf6a3d231822ed41f8e0b29","amp;dn":"The+Nurture+Versus+Biosocial+Debate+in+Criminology+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccd3f26dfb707fbadf6a3d231822ed41f8e0b29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,205,63,38,223,183,7,251,173,246,163,210,49,130,46,212,31,142,11,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
