The Sun Never Shines\n\nPersonnel: Ryan Boldt (vocals); Burke Barlow (electric guitar); Steve Dawson (ukulele); Adam Iredale-Gray (fiddle); Chris Gestrin (piano); Chris Mason (bass instrument); Lucas Goetz (drums).\n\n&quot;The timeless sound of the aptly named &quot;The Deep Dark Woods&quot; belongs to the depressing winters of the north. Pulsing with human warmth, these original songs echo through the lonesome night. Ryan Boldt's plainspoken lyrics oer a strong but gentle tone which understates poetry, oftentimes as startling as hot blood in fresh snow. Despite the dark themes, the heaviness never overwhelms the music's playfulness. An utterly fun rhythm section, brilliant guitar work, and eerily rich harmonies drive the songs. One could easily be forgiven for mistaking their songs as treasures of decades past, as The Deep Dark Woods approach their instruments with studied respect for the honoured traditions of the shadowy side of roots music.\n\nWinter Hours, The Deep Dark Woods' sophomore release on Black Hen Music, is an album full of raw emotion, sadness, beautiful vocals and harmonies, new sounds, and well thought out arrangements. Working with Juno award winning producer/musician Steve Dawson at Vancouver's famed recording studio The Factory, they managed to bring out an energy that the new songs deserved, recording the album live off the floor. Winter Hours is a step forward from their widely touted first release Hang Me, Oh Hang Me.&quot; (Black Hen Music)\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\n[img]http://www.hotimg.com/direct/CAWuxEb.gif[/img]\n\nht[url]tp://dickthespic.org/2011/10/31/the-deep-dark-woods/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9895a7f6a4396d28cd523d48aadcf37d4d5b2f","amp;dn":"The+Deep+Dark+Woods...Winter+Hours%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9895a7f6a4396d28cd523d48aadcf37d4d5b2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,152,149,167,246,164,57,109,40,205,82,61,72,170,220,243,125,77,91,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
