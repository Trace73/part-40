Powerage contains all the familiar AC/DC trademarks: Bon Scott's rather less than Yeatsian lyrical vision (&quot;Rock &amp; Roll Damnation,&quot; &quot;Up to My Neck in You&quot;), Angus Young's brilliantly minimal guitar playing, a rhythm section as relentless and efficient as an infantry regiment, and the astute production of former Easybeats Harry Vanda and George Young; however, it lacks a truly transcendent moment, a &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie&quot; or a &quot;T.N.T.&quot; Of course, even an average AC/DC album is an eloquent lesson in the fundamentals of rock &amp; roll, and by that token Powerage still blows most opposition out of the water. Bon Scott's exultant declaration of working-class solidarity, &quot;Riff Raff,&quot; is worth six Bon Jovi albums on its own. \n\nby Andrew Mueller \n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Rock 'n' Roll Damnation.wma            \n02 - Down Payment Blues.wma                 \n03 - Gimme A Bullet.wma                     \n04 - Riff Raff.wma                          \n05 - Sin City.wma                           \n06 - What's Next To The Moon.wma            \n07 - Gone Shootin'.wma                      \n08 - Up To My Neck In You.wma               \n09 - Kicked In The Teeth.wma\n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cef8c2411f2cc36b8b92698caa7f4c9fda3f28e","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Powerage+%281978%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cef8c2411f2cc36b8b92698caa7f4c9fda3f28e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,239,140,36,17,242,204,54,184,185,38,152,202,167,244,201,253,163,242,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
