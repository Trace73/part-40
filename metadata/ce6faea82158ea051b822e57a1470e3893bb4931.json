Well, you even do not need to install Windows. Just download WinOnX and you are ready to go within 2 minutes. \nPLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING:\n\n- WinOnX should only be used for applications which are not available for OSX. Whenever an application is available for OSX, we strongly recommend to use this version.\n\n- WinOnX is based on the open source Wine project. It is a layer which redirects the communication between an application and Windows to OSX. As a result not all applications are fully compatible. Most applications run fine, some run even faster but also some run slower or even crash.\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nVersion 1.6:\n\n- Fixes for Yosemite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce6faea82158ea051b822e57a1470e3893bb4931","amp;dn":"WinOnX.v1.6.MacOSX.Retail-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce6faea82158ea051b822e57a1470e3893bb4931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,111,174,168,33,88,234,5,27,130,46,87,161,71,14,56,147,187,73,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
