The group signed to Polygram in 1997 and released two singles, &quot;The World Is Dead&quot; and &quot;Weathermen,&quot; which did moderately well on Irish radio, but when it came time to record a full-length album, contractual rules from the label prevented Juniper from doing so, and Rice split. After a brief respite in Europe, Rice returned to Dublin to focus on music once again, scrounging up enough money to record a demo. He sent it to producer/film composer David Arnold (BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk, Nina Persson, Paul Oakenfold), and luckily for him, Arnold loved it and set Rice up in his very own mobile studio to make a record. His first single, &quot;The Blower's Daughter,&quot; was an instant Top 20 hit when it appeared in fall 2001. Shared gigs with McAlmont &amp; Butler and folkie Kathryn Williams followed in summer 2002 when Rice released O in the U.K. The album hit the States in 2003, which earned the Irishman a dedicated group of American fans in addition to his European ones, and after satiating all of them with a collection of B-sides in 2005, Rice released his sophomore record, 9.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dbaec9125b70f0809c158453fe85f49d11414db","amp;dn":"O+-+Damien+Rice+%5BEAC%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dbaec9125b70f0809c158453fe85f49d11414db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,186,236,145,37,183,15,8,9,193,88,69,63,232,95,73,209,20,20,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
