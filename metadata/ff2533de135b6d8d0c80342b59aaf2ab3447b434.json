TPB's trackers are down. But I've been anticipating something like this for a while. So for those who'll want to download torrents I've made and will make in the future, I'm moving nearly all of them to another torrent-site, maybe two. I guess it'll be at least: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nJust browse for the torrents on that site, and all uploads will come up, just give me some days.. :-)\n\nAnd you can still start your download from this site!! Just add these trackers to the torrent, and we'll find each other again.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;\n \nNow don't click on the &quot;links&quot; above, that won't work. Copy and paste them to add them to your trackers in the torrent-file.\n\nAnd be sure to enable DHT. It tracks too..\n  \nAnyway, they should also all be available by search on my alias, verifire, on for instance: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.isoHunt.com&lt;/a&gt;\n \n- because they search the contents and comments on the upload for tags as well as the title of the torrent.. Just give me some time..\n\nSee you later, when things are settled and (maybe) there's a working tracker on the site again, and I'll miss it terribly, but I hope for, and guess this isn't the last word on the matter. I'll upload stuff here anyway, as well as on the other sites...\n\nTPB WILL ALWAYS RULE!! THANK YOU, GUYS. YOU'VE BEEN A PLEASURE TO BE SHIPWRECKED WITH. IT'S AN HONOUR...\n\nVerifire.\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nI'm at the moment being constantly monitored and hindered in sharing Christian material. For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nWell.. It took some time, but I've finally translated the movie into Norwegian.\nIt's hardsubbed, and should be acceptable for screening on for instance a projector, or simply on your everyday TV-screen.\n\nHallo..\n\nDet har tatt litt tid, men nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ foreligger denne filmen med norske undertekster. Den er hardsubbed, og skulle vÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦re av akseptabel kvalitet for fremvisning via f.eks. en projektor, eller ganske enkelt pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ TV'n din.\n\nAnd: PLEASE REMEMBER TO HELP SEEDING THIS! It takes up a lot of my not so yielding broadband if I'm the only one to seed it..\n\n&quot;Freely you've been given. Now freely give..&quot; That's actually a commandment from Him this movie is all about..\n\n\nFOR TRANSLATORS, FÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œR ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œVERSÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¾TTARE, FOR TEKSTERE:\n\nHi there, Hej pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ er, og Go'dag til jer..\n\nI,ve made the timed, Norwegian, subtitles to &quot;Lee Strobel - The Case for Christ&quot; into three different formats: Advanced SubStation Alpha-format:  .ass, SubStation Alpha: .ssa, and as Sub Rip-format: .srt. and upload them for other translators to use.\n\nThey might be of some assistance to those who'll take on the (important) task of translating this movie into Swedish, to Finnish, Danish and German and so on. They're quite accurate, both in timing and content, and therefore they should be helpful.\nThey can be downloaded from here:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4972445&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4972445&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNi Svenskar kan ju sprÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ket sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r, eller hur?\nOg I danskere der finder at det er bryet verd, sku' heller ikke have nogen sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¦rlige problemer.\n\nFinlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndare kan ju ofta tala Svenska, sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ kan dom ju ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶versetta vidare..\nDie Deutche verleicht kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼nnen die Danishe ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼bersertzen? Ich weiss nichts, und kann nichts.. MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ske en Dansker ku' tage sig an opgaven osse med de Tyske..? :-)\n\nThe version of this film without any subs to which the subs in this upload fits, can be downloaded from here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4013128/The_Case_For_Christ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4013128/The_Case_For_Christ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSo. Good luck and Peace from The Lord our God with translating this well made documentary, which I think is an important movie for educational purposes and for answering and refuting so many of the misconceptions and doubts surrounding Jesus of Nazareth..\n\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;b7c1d2c5ded1dec5d2dad6dedbf7d0dad6dedb99d4d8da&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff2533de135b6d8d0c80342b59aaf2ab3447b434","amp;dn":"The+Case+For+Christ+-+Sannheten+Om+Jesus+%5B2007%5D+-+XviD+NorSub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff2533de135b6d8d0c80342b59aaf2ab3447b434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,37,51,222,19,91,109,141,12,128,52,43,89,170,242,171,52,71,180,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
