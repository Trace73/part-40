None the less, this band blew me away and I just had to share it with the torrent community. So please enjoy this up brought to you by RG, Those of The Unlight, and Please remember to seed afterward for everyone to have.\n\n\n\nAnother Quality Release by:THOSE OF THE UNLIGHT\n\nMork_Blasphemy &amp; Metal_Behemoth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1176fec9cc05b720bcd702079e7e86a28a4b01b4","amp;dn":"Quo+Vadis+%28Poland%29+2010+-+Infernal+Chaos+%7Bbehemoth%7D+TTU+RG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1176fec9cc05b720bcd702079e7e86a28a4b01b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,118,254,201,204,5,183,32,188,215,2,7,158,126,134,162,138,75,1,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
