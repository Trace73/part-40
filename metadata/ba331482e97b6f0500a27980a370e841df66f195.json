When Jake is betrayed, his only escape is to take the potentially deadly super-soldier formula and become a &quot;Psycho&quot; himself. Jake lives, changes, and gains new amazing powers -- and begins the hunt for the traitor.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Freaks of the Heartland | (Steve Niles) [GN]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9143472&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9143472&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Lazerhawk - Redline (2010) [320kbps]:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9100669&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9100669&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! ** ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba331482e97b6f0500a27980a370e841df66f195","amp;dn":"The+Psycho+%7C+%28James+D.+Hudnall%29+%282006%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba331482e97b6f0500a27980a370e841df66f195","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,51,20,130,233,123,111,5,0,162,121,128,163,112,232,65,223,102,241,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
