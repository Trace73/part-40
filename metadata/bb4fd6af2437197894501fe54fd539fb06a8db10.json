It was recorded live at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado on August 15, 1995. The album is known on the Internet by the abbreviation L@RR. The band's performance was during the third consecutive year at which they had played at the venue (although in 1993 only as a warm up for The Tragically Hip / The Samples.)[2] Guitarist Tim Reynolds guested with the band during the entire show. Most of the songs featured were from the band's most recent album Under the Table and Dreaming. &quot;Ants Marching,&quot; &quot;Satellite,&quot; &quot;Seek Up,&quot; &quot;Recently,&quot; and &quot;Tripping Billies&quot; originally appeared on the band's first album, Remember Two Things, while &quot;Proudest Monkey,&quot; &quot;Two Step,&quot; &quot;Lie in Our Graves,&quot; and &quot;Drive In Drive Out&quot; would not appear as studio recordings until the release of Crash in 1996. &quot;#36&quot; was later reworked into the song &quot;Everyday,&quot; which was included on the album of the same name in 2001. Also included is the band's cover of &quot;All Along the Watchtower.&quot;\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Seek Up\n[02] Proudest Monkey\n[03] Satellite\n[04] Two Step\n[05] Best Of What's Around\n[06] Recently\n[07] Lie In Our Graves\n[08] Dancing Nancies\n[09] Warehouse\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:13m:07s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Tripping Billies\n[02] Drive In, Drive Out\n[03] Lover Lay Down\n[04] Rhyme &amp; Reason\n[05] #36\n[06] Ants Marching\n[07] Typical Situation\n[08] All Along The Watchtower\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 00h:58m:22s\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:11m:29s\nTotal File Size....................... 313mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
