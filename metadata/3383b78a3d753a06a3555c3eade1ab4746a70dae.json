This presentation is much nicer, the only *\n* problem being a minor deterioration in continuity when notes refer to each other. *\n*************************************************************************************\n\nContains:\n\nSISTERS AT WAR - The first volume. Repackaged Lo-Res Digital-TPB with separate notes.\n\nDAUGHTERS OF STONE - The second volume. Repackaged Hi-Res Digital-TPB.
