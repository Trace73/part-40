A one word name. From the Faroe Islands. There are almost no trees, just rocks, green pastures, beautiful views, wind and rain. Lots of rain. He is an artist whose music and lyrics remind you what songs can do for the soul. Teitur..s 2003 debut album ..Poetry &amp; Aeroplanes.. displayed a warm organic sound combining his unique acoustic guitar playing and one take vocals with subtle, beautiful arrangements, winning over fans around the world as it was gradually released in over 12 countries. Teitur toured non-stop in support of his debut, initially playing intimate acoustic shows, slowly winning over bigger and bigger audiences as he fleshed out his live performances with a band and sometimes string quartet, playing over 350 shows around the world including more than 150 in North America.\n\nTo record his second album Teitur enlisted the help of London based, Swedish producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, A-Ha, Ron Sexsmith and new UK no.1 act James Morrison) to produce the album at Martin..s retro cool Kensaltown Studios in London. The result of the recording is the stunning album ..Stay Under The Stars,.. a dynamic and well crafted collection of songs reflecting Teitur..s unique view on stories, situations and life as well as his newer, fuller live sound and wider outlook on the world. The album debuted in the Top 10 in Denmark and was followed by a number of high profile performances at European festivals such as Les Eurokeenes Festival in France and Benecassim in Spain where he played with a dazzling 10 piece Orchestra!\n\nTjeck him out at &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teitur.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teitur.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c41db38b197baedd49f1c662471e342cb7ca519c","amp;dn":"Collection+of+Teitur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c41db38b197baedd49f1c662471e342cb7ca519c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,29,179,139,25,123,174,221,73,241,198,98,71,30,52,44,183,202,81,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
