This ragtag bunch of vault dwellers and passed over tunes written by the company's third and fourth tier writers and producers has a misleading title: there are few creams and it's a bad crop. The sole star is their scintillating remake of Johnny &amp; Jackey's forgotten &quot;Someday We'll Be Together&quot; -- their last hurrah, and a few other honorable mentions, namely &quot;The Young Folks&quot; and &quot;You Gave Me Love.&quot; Despite the shortcomings, it wrangled its way to number 33 on Billboard's Pop Chart.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.Someday We'll Be Together \n02.Can't You See It's Me \n03.You Gave Me Love \n04.Hey Jude \n05.Young Folks \n06.Shadows Of Society \n07.Loving You Is Better Than Ever \n08.When It's To The Top (Still I Won't Stop Giving You Love) \n09.Till Johnny Comes \n10.Blowin' In The Wind \n11.Beginning Of The End \n\n\n*Label: Motown Records/Universal Music Japan | # UICY-75230 | Time: 00:32:58\n\nAll thanks goes to the original releaser!\n\n\n\nDiana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Love Child (1968) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8565152/Diana_Ross__amp__The_Supremes_-_Love_Child_(1968)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8565152/Diana_Ross__amp__The_Supremes_-_Love_Child_(1968)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0f8aaf3c4f0b72fbd0ebfc72a4c79022bb76f80","amp;dn":"Diana+Ross+%26amp%3B+The+Supremes+-+Cream+Of+The+Crop+%281969%29+%5BEAC-FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0f8aaf3c4f0b72fbd0ebfc72a4c79022bb76f80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,248,170,243,196,240,183,47,189,14,191,199,42,76,121,2,43,183,111,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
