With Keisha Castle-Hughes, Rawiri Paratene, Vicky Haughton.\n\nIn a small New Zealand coastal village, Maori claim descent from Paikea, the Whale Rider. In every generation for more than 1000 years, a male heir born to the Chief succeeds to the title.\n\nThe time is now. The Chief's eldest son, Porourangi, fathers twins - a boy and a girl. But the boy and his mother die in childbirth. The surviving girl is named Paikea, nicknamed Pai.\n\nGrief-stricken, her father leaves her to be raised by her grandparents. Koro, her grandfather who is the Chief, refuses to acknowledge Pai as the inheritor of the tradition and claims she is of no use to him. But her grandmother, Flowers, sees more than a broken line, she sees a child in desperate need of love.\n\nAnd Koro learns to love the child. When Pai's father, Porourangi, now a feted international artist, returns home after twelve years, Koro hopes everything is resolved and Porourangi will to accept destiny and become his successor.\n\nBut Porourangi has no intention of becoming Chief. He has moved away from his people both physically and emotionally. After a bitter argument with Koro he leaves, suggesting to Pai that she come with him. She starts the journey but quickly returns, claiming her grandfather needs her.\n\nKoro is blinded by prejudice and even Flowers cannot convince him that Pai is the natural heir. The old Chief is convinced that the tribe's misfortunes began at Pai's birth and calls for his people to bring their firstborn boys to him for training. He is certain that through a gruelling process of teaching the ancient chants, tribal lore and warrior techniques, the future leader of their tribe will be revealed to him.\n\nMeanwhile, deep within the ocean, a massive herd of whales is responding, drawn towards Pai and their twin destinies.\n\nWhen the whales become stranded on the beach, Koro is sure this signals an apocalyptic end to his tribe. Until one person prepares to make the ultimate sacrifice to save the people...the Whale Rider.\n\n*** 2-pass 360p encoding for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 640x360 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994f9f04bb128aca0979c9b2136aff5fabe27402","amp;dn":"Whale.Rider.2002.DVDrip.360p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994f9f04bb128aca0979c9b2136aff5fabe27402","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,79,159,4,187,18,138,202,9,121,201,178,19,106,255,95,171,226,116,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
