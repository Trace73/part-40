In his mid-70s at the time, Slim's energetic vocals and powerful piano playing belie his age. As is typical of the pioneer Chicago bluesman, he allocated plenty of solo space to his sidemen (which include Hubert Sumlin, Eddie Taylor, Lurrie Bell or Magic Slim on guitar) although there was never any doubt about who was in control. The intelligent lyrics, high musicianship, mood variation (including two excellent instrumentals) and spirited playing make this a highly enjoyable and recommended ...oh! what the Hell...fuck you... \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c047ef98e53af865960cd57cc7390e4c1b71bb8f","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Sunnyland+Slim+-+Be+Careful+How+You+Vote","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c047ef98e53af865960cd57cc7390e4c1b71bb8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,71,239,152,229,58,248,101,150,12,213,124,199,57,14,76,27,113,187,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
