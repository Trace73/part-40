Ward, and Tom Smith of the indie rock group Editors.\n\nThe tracks were recorded over the course of one week in January 2010, in Portland, Oregon. The album charted in over a half dozen countries.\n\nI came upon this album quite by accident and so glad I did. What a gem.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa6b051b4f27a54234dad08fad40b2b9d66e256f","amp;dn":"Tired+Pony+-+The+Place+We+Ran+From+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa6b051b4f27a54234dad08fad40b2b9d66e256f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,107,5,27,79,39,165,66,52,218,208,143,173,64,178,185,214,110,37,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
