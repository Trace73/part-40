This re-release hits the shelves in time to coincide with DeathstarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ tour of Europe in support of Korn in early 2008.\n\nThat support slot should give you some idea of the demographic that Deathstars are pitching for, but for a better idea of their musical style, their tour with Cradle Of Filth in 2006 is more telling; Termination Bliss is a very theatrical metal album, almost to the point of total overstatement.\n\nBlending super-heavy guitar work with icy-cold synthesizer melodies and a mix of real and digital percussion, Termination Bliss deals with themes of nihilism, war, destruction and mortality in simple terms, with the lyrics delivered in a operatic and guttural growl. There arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t going to be any prizes for poetic writing and insightful perspectives here.\n\nBut thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the point; Deathstars appear to be playing a game of aesthetics rather than trying to tell their listeners something new. Not for them the bleak introspection of Nine Inch Nails or the political rage of Ministry; DeathstarsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ songs mention angels and demons, death, dead gods, war and poison. Classic mainstream goth material, in other words.\n\nMusically, Deathstars are following the path cleared by Rammstein, who have pretty much written the book on joyously overblown metal theatre. And thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the proof of the pudding ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ people love them for the bombast, the showmanship, the coherence of the look and sound and style. Deathstars look set to strike a similar chord with young metal fans, with the added bonus of lyrics in English that scrape the surface of themes and topics that will be familiar from the output of Marilyn Manson and others ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ sure-fire parent-distressing material.\n\nThis may all sound a little dismissive, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not meant to; what IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m trying to say is that Deathstars have successfully brought the pop approach to the industrial sound. The music itself is nothing particularly new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ being a continuation of the strengthening European trend]for highly melodic heavy metal with industrial trappings thrown in to the mix ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but music is only half of the game.\n\nNowadays a band needs to become a coherent lifestyle brand to really make a mark, especially in the teen market ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and in this respect, Deathstars are set to carve a swathe of destruction in their wake. Termination Bliss may not be rocket science, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s aimed perfectly for maximum impact.\n.: Dati Tecnici :.\n\nBitrate\nTongues (186 Kbps)\nMotherzone (205 Kbps)\nCyanide (207 Kbps)\nThe Greatest Fight on Earth (195 Kbps)\nPlay God (195 Kbps)\nTrinity Fields (194 Kbps)\nThe Last Ammunition (197 Kbps)\nVirtue to Vice (193 Kbps)\nDeath in Vogue (195 Kbps)\nTermination Bliss (197 Kbps)\nTermination Bliss (Piano Remix) (186 Kbps)\nBlitzkrieg (Driven on Remix) (192 Kbps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01f8efae9606ea2481992feda5a1ddb3891fbb2a","amp;dn":"Deathstars+-+Termination+Bliss+%5BMp3+192+Kbps+VBR%5D+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01f8efae9606ea2481992feda5a1ddb3891fbb2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,248,239,174,150,6,234,36,129,153,47,237,165,161,221,179,137,31,187,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
