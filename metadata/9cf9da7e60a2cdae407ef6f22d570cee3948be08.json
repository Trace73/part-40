You gain a couple of kB's for what? People upload Blu-Ray rips which go around 2-40 GB's (depending on the container (mkv and the likes)) but for something as precious as music, you go and upload shit. Yes, there's FLAC (thank &quot;god&quot;), but not everyone knows how to convert FLAC to MP3s for portable use. \n\nBrought to you by neuroxik","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cf9da7e60a2cdae407ef6f22d570cee3948be08","amp;dn":"The+Used+-+Hands+and+Faces+%28320+kbs+CBR%2C+frolnerable+album%29+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cf9da7e60a2cdae407ef6f22d570cee3948be08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,249,218,126,96,162,205,174,64,126,246,242,45,87,12,238,57,72,190,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
