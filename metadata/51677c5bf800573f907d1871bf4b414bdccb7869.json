The name stands for \\&quot;Operating System/2,\\&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM\\'s \\&quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)\\&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51677c5bf800573f907d1871bf4b414bdccb7869","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+2.1+-+Simp+Chinese+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51677c5bf800573f907d1871bf4b414bdccb7869","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,103,124,91,248,0,87,63,144,125,24,113,191,75,65,75,220,203,120,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
