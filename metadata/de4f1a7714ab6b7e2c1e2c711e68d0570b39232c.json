On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a little and enjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4f1a7714ab6b7e2c1e2c711e68d0570b39232c","amp;dn":"Bicentennial+Gross-Outs+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4f1a7714ab6b7e2c1e2c711e68d0570b39232c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,79,26,119,20,171,107,126,44,30,44,113,30,104,208,87,11,57,35,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
