(It copied from a videorecorder. Take it for what it is.)\n\nScreen: 4:3\n\n\n\n\nPlot:\nUproar in Heaven is based on the famous novel, Pilgrimage to the West, the amazing adventures of the monk Xuanzang as he travels westward in search of Buddhist sutras. It relates how Sun Wukong borrows the golden cudgel from the Dragon Palace; takes a poor position in Heaven and then is demoted and even gets unfair punishment; and how he is pushed beyond the limit of endurance and makes a big scene in Heaven. Finally Sun returns to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, entitling himself a king equal to Heaven.\n\n\nComments:\nThis is my first torrent ever. Please let me know if there is anything wrong with the file. I will try to correct it.\n\n/CigarBear2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6602ae9585b3eb69b0f9df65b772027f33e8e6a0","amp;dn":"Apkungen+-+Da+Nao+Tian+Gong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6602ae9585b3eb69b0f9df65b772027f33e8e6a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,2,174,149,133,179,235,105,176,249,223,101,183,114,2,127,51,232,230,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
