[1986]\n\nJr. Gone Wild were a country/punk band from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, founded in 1984.The band's original members were Mike McDonald, David Lawson, Graham Brown and Kim Upright. In 1986 the band recorded the album &quot;Less Art More Pop&quot; on the B.Y.O label. The band broke up in 1995.\n\nThis LP is an absolute blinder and I'll never understand why the band never got more recognition. A single track like 'Cosmos' is worth every recording that tax-dodging, pompous blow-hards like U2 ever recorded.\n\n\ntRaCkS:\n\n1.it never changes\n2.heather on a bad day\n3.goodness\n4.cosmos\n5.hey paula\n6.she'll never know\n7.god is not my father\n8.old blue\n9.slept all afternoon\n10.tragedy in e\n11.i fell dumb\n12.day of the first snow\n13.fine scotch\n14.why i hate the 60's\n\n(cool punk typography, no?)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f8b6264154906d683a488c7828ca137d71d379","amp;dn":"Jr+Gone+Wild+-++Less+Art+More+Pop%21+%5B1987%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f8b6264154906d683a488c7828ca137d71d379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,248,182,38,65,84,144,109,104,58,72,140,120,40,202,19,125,113,211,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
