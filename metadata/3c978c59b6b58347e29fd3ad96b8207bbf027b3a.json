But victory has come at a terrible cost for the UNSC. Thousands of valiant soldiers fell in the battle to prevent the alien construct from falling into the enemyÃƒÂ¢??s clutches.\n\nNow, everything depends on the Spartan known as the ÃƒÂ¢??Master Chief.ÃƒÂ¢?? Yet even with the aid of the artificial intelligence Cortana, the Master Chief will be hard-pressed to rescue survivors and evade the Covenant ships patrolling the remains of Halo in debris-strewn space.\n\nAhead lies a dangerous voyage home, through a gauntlet of Covenant forces. For the sake of all, the Master Chief and his war-torn squad must not only survive, but take the fight to the enemy with a decisive first strike.\n\nAudio:\n\nFile Type - mp3\nBitrate - 128kb\\s\nChannels - Joint Stereo\nForm - Chaptered\n\nThis is my second upload, Tell me if there is anything wrong.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nBy the way, I highly recommend this site:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://themes.belchfire.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://themes.belchfire.net/&lt;/a&gt;\nYou can get themes, boot screens, logon screens, cursors, sounds, wallpapers ect.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\nPlz Seed!\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c978c59b6b58347e29fd3ad96b8207bbf027b3a","amp;dn":"Halo+-+First+Strike+%28Chaptered+Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c978c59b6b58347e29fd3ad96b8207bbf027b3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,151,140,89,182,181,131,71,226,159,211,173,150,184,32,123,191,2,123,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
