From  issues such as monogamy, emotional equality, and love, take a detailed look at  the human persona as never seen before. The Human Sexes was made in 1997 and  wrote and presented for The Learning Channel, a six one-hour television  programmes on the relationship between men and women.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Author/Presenter - Desmond morris\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDesmond Morris was born 24 January 1928 in the village of Purton, north  Wiltshire, UK. He is most famous for his work as a zoologist and ethologist  and was educated at Dauntsey&amp;#039;s School, a boys&amp;#039; independent school in West  Lavington, Wiltshire, and then at the University of Birmingham and the  University of Oxford. He first came to public attention in the 1950s as a  presenter of the ITV television programme Zoo Time. His studies focus on  animal and human behaviour, explained from a zoological point of view. He has  written a number of books and produced a number of television shows. His  examination of humans from a bluntly zoological point of view has attracted  controversy. His book &quot;The Naked Ape&quot; was one of the wonders of the 1960s,  describing humans in the kind of language we were accustomed to use about the  rest of the animal kingdom and explaining how we evolved to be the way we are.  In 1994 he did a TV series called &quot;The Human Animal&quot; on the same theme.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       The Human Sexes - the six part series\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough Desmond Morris allows that the way we look and act can be traced to a  combination of genetics, biology and societal influences, he is especially on  the alert for evolutionary factors. It is no accident, he argues, with  examples from many cultures, that boys like to play football and girls like to  play with dolls. Beneath roles that seem to be imposed by their cultures, he  finds primitive needs. \n\nFor men, the basic need that the body remembers and transmits is hunting, and  for women, rearing and food gathering. A lingering look at a topless beach  makes the point in an agreeable way. Those fatty deposits so useful for  childbearing and nursing also, happily, turn out to be stimulants to  heterosexual romance. When women go in for heavy muscle building, the results  displayed here are likely to seem grotesque to many viewers, perhaps a signal  that this isn&amp;#039;t what comes naturally. He introduces us to the differences in  the body and the brain, sex-specific rituals, sex and parenting roles and the  status of the sexes in different societies around the globe.\n\nSome of the material here is familiar, some surprising; some is plainly chosen  for color, yet is revealing; some of it examines serious matters, some just  fools around. If the result sounds like Anthropology Lite, that is not too far  off the mark. Whether biologically conditioned or telegenetically adapted, The  Human Sexes makes for very easy watching.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart 1:\nDifferent but Equal \nDesmond Morris looks at the evolutionary reasons for men looking like men and  women looking like women. For example you can learn why men and women cross  their legs differently. Men have trouble with the knee-knee cross, follow  directions differently Women depend on landmarks, men on maps.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d331987075d8b7e83ec8a89750518e6247aae24d","amp;dn":"Discovery+The+Human+Sexes+1+of+6+Desmond+Morris","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d331987075d8b7e83ec8a89750518e6247aae24d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,49,152,112,117,216,183,232,62,200,168,151,80,81,142,98,71,170,226,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
