It's dogfighting meets figure-skating in space.&quot;\n\nModule 3 changelog (31.10.2014):\nNew interface:\n- ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS may be the first game on Steam to use UnityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest 4.6 beta (v20)! By switching up our core engine like this, we were able to rip out a lot of our old interface code and use UnityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new UI, making awesome new menus and HUD components that are much more responsive, better animated, more flexible, and it will really cut down future development time and allow for cool new features.\nA proper settings menu:\n- Want to adjust various volume settings? Want the ability to toggle bigger game features? Want to redefine your keyboard, or map your crazy off-brand controller without diving into configuration files? Well this update is for you! In addition to all that stuff being available right now, we have also paved the way for opening up many more configurable options in the future. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll keep you posted on what we add here!\nA team select screen that makes sense:\n- In addition to having super cute team names randomly generated each game, the team setups are now much more intuitive with clear on-screen instructions.\nNew visual effects pipeline:\n- If you are anything like us here at Mission Control, you yawn at standard gamma colour spaces and normal-range lighting present in most modern games. They look soÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Normal!Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ So we decided to take things to the next level. ROCKETSROCKETSROCKETS is now completely presented with high-dynamic-range (HDR) cameras and a linear colour space. This allows us to quite literally turn the brightness of somethingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ to 11. Prepare your sun-tan lotion, because our bloom and lighting effects are now brighter and more colourful than ever before. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a veritable colour-soup in there.\nAchievements:\n- ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s this one guy that keeps posting in our forums demanding Steam Achievements. We are pleased to announce that we have finally caved, and over twenty achievements are now available! And this is just the start Ã¢â‚¬â€ every update weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll release more.. and more!! AND MOORE!!\nA spooky mission map:\n- Get your costumes on and check out the Steam Workshop! WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a spooky custom map just for you!\nAnd more:\n- WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got months of code and art changes queued up in this update, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find a ton of little things might have changed - visual blips here and there, new visual effects, slightly modified rocket handling, even more exposed modding tools, better score tolerances, and even a new techno track from our fantastic musician Ben Lam.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/289760/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/289760/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7733feb882dc4f97c7031ad09688bd7ebf48fb58","amp;dn":"RocketsRocketsRockets+%28Rockets+Rockets+Rockets%29+Module+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7733feb882dc4f97c7031ad09688bd7ebf48fb58","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,51,254,184,130,220,79,151,199,3,26,208,150,136,189,126,191,72,251,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
