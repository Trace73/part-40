From the awkward conversation to the strained laughter to the moments of sheer bewilderment (Did he just call me Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poopsy?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½), dating is not an activity for the easily discouraged. Thankfully, Justin Racz returns with this newest installment to help ease the romantic pain. These would-be Casanovas remind us that there are worse times to be had. Including entries such as: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Creepy Non-Blinker,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Keeps Telling You How Much You Remind Him of His Sister,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Mechanical Bull Riding,&quot; Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lap Dog Girl,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Invites you over and is wearing pajamas when you arrive,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 50 Dates Worse Than Yours presents just about every blindingly bad date around. Filled with entertaining photographs and outrageous bullet points listing each prospective partnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hideous traits, this is the perfect gift for anyone who has ever faked food poisoning just to get away from that guy her aunt set her up with.\n\nCONTENTS\n1.
