This is not a copy of the later bad DVD version, which was mickey mouse vhs transfer with bad 192k mp3 sound.  This is one I transfered from my old VHS video, which aside from a couple of early crinks, looks and sounds better than the DVD version of the show.\n\nThis again is a SVCD, which you can watch the mpeg file in any media player or burn it onto a CD rom as a SVCD(with Nero for example), which plays on most dvd players.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb706022e928ec22b8665498e24875e56ca9dbb5","amp;dn":"Christian+Death+Live+1993+Video+SVCD+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb706022e928ec22b8665498e24875e56ca9dbb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,112,96,34,233,40,236,34,184,102,84,152,226,72,117,229,108,169,219,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
