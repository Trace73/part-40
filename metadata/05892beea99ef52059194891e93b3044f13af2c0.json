With so much top-rate talent, you might think\nthis comedy is destined to be a classic. However, there\nare some worrisome signs\n\nFor one, it's been scheduled for the theatrical release\ndumping zone that is January. Secondly, the movie doesn't\nappear to be screening for critics at all. Third, none of\nstars are promoting the film in any way shape or form\nAnd lastly, its producer Peter Farrelly has revealed that\nthe cast signed on not so much because of a great script\nbut because Farrelly and his fellow producers were dogged\nin their pursuit of them\n\nThe NY Post reports Movie 43 has long been a passion\nproject of Farrelly's and his producing partner Charlie\nWessler, who dreamed of making a comedy in the vein of\nKentucky Fried Movie. This was not a project that appealed\nto most studios, but Wessler got the ball rolling by\nconvincing Jackman to sign on after the two met at a\nwedding. From there they somehow snagged Winslet, and then\nused their names to lure in more luminaries. Still, the\npair faced flat-out rejection from some stars, like George\nClooney. When asked if he'd like to cameo as himself in a\nsketch where he'd fail to pick up women, Clooney's response\nwas a curt: &quot;No fucking way\n\nOther big names that dropped out of the project include\nSouth Park's Trey Parker and Matt Stone as well as Kentucky\nFried Movie scribes David and Jerry Zucker, and Colin Farrell,\nwho was slated to appear opposite Butler in a\nleprechaun-centered short. Butler has commented that Farrell\noffered a lame excuse about stepping out, adding, &quot;Colin, you\nsaw sense and backed out - admit it\n\nLess fortunate it seems was Richard Gere, who as a friend of\nWessler's initially agreed to play a part in the film, but\nthen attempted to dodge it for more than a year. For most\nproductions this would be enough to get an actor out. But\nwith Movie 43's long list of directors and thereby limber\nshooting schedule, this tactic didn't work. Finally, Gere\nagreed to play a dopey computer designer who doesn't\nunderstand why young boys are humping his iBabe creation on\ntwo conditions: it had to be shot in four days, and in\nLos Angeles, not New York. Regrettably for Gere, these\nconditions were met easily enough\n\nEven Farrelly admits of his stars, &quot;They clearly wanted out\nBut we wouldn't let them.&quot; He goes on to say this project was\nmade under a simple strategy: &quot;Wait for them. Shoot when they\nwant to shoot. Guilt them to death\n\nSource &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Guilt-Tripped-Stars-Won-t-Promote-Movie-43-35270.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Guilt-Tripped-Stars-Won-t-Promote-Movie-43-35270.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4eeRGGe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/4eeRGGe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uiBOTRE.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/uiBOTRE.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/o7kw9i5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/o7kw9i5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JRXGL0C.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/JRXGL0C.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5hIsPF3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5hIsPF3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1X3l5Wc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/1X3l5Wc.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05892beea99ef52059194891e93b3044f13af2c0","amp;dn":"Movie.43.2013.720p.BluRay.x264-DAA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05892beea99ef52059194891e93b3044f13af2c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,137,43,238,169,158,245,32,89,25,72,145,233,59,48,68,241,58,242,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
