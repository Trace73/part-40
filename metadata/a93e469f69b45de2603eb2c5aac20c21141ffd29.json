option for the GPO created for installations of previous versions. \nWhen upgrading a build of Acronis True Image Echo Backup Server earlier than 8163 to Acronis Backup &amp; Recovery 10 Storage Node, it is recommended that the Acronis Backup Server service is stopped during the upgrade; otherwise the locations may not be imported correctly. \nAcronis Virtual Appliance does not restore the enhanced vmxnet adapter to a new virtual machine \nThe &quot;Task failure handling&quot; option does not work for the &quot;Tower of Hanoi&quot;

(See below the outline of the update procedure.) After that, you will be able to perform updates from the management server in the same way as deployment.\n\nTo update Agent for ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliance:\n\nUpdate the management server. \nRemove the virtual appliance from the management server. \nDelete the virtual appliance from its host. \nRevoke the license used by the agent. \nDeploy the agent anew from the management server (one agent per cluster). \nReapply backup policies if required. \nMore details of the update procedure can be found in the product help system and the Virtual Edition Installation Guide (search for &quot;Updating ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliance&quot;, see &quot;Manual update&quot; in this section).\n\nAn alternative method of backing up a cluster\n\nBackup of all virtual machines of a cluster with a single Agent for ESX/ESXi may take a significant amount of time. If length of the backup window is important, try the following workaround.\n\nDeploy Agent for ESX/ESXi to each clustered host instead of deploying a single agent to the cluster. You can do so from the management server. Just right-click the Virtual machines item instead of the vCenter group. \nIf VMware DRS is enabled in the cluster, disable automatic migration of Agent for ESX/ESXi Virtual Appliances. You also should not migrate them manually to different hosts, in order to avoid the situation when an agent manages a host other than its own. Backup and recovery performance would considerably degrade in that case. \nCreate a dynamic group of virtual machines hosted on the clustered hosts. Use the Host/VA criterion for the group. \nCreate a backup policy and apply the policy to the dynamic group. Once a virtual machine migrates to a different host, the management server will deploy a backup task for this machine to the agent that manages that host. \n\nSupported operating systems (Workstation)\nWindows 2000 SP (Service Pack) 4+\nWindows XP SP2+ x32 and x64 Editions\nWindows Vista all SP x32 and x64 Editions\nWindows 7 x32 and x64 Editions* \n\nSupported operating systems (Server)\nWindows 2000 Server SP 4+\nWindows 2003 Server SP 2+ x32 and x64 Editions\nWindows 2008 Server SP2 x32 and x64 Editions*\nWindows 2008 Server Foundation \nWindows 2008 Server R2\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a93e469f69b45de2603eb2c5aac20c21141ffd29","amp;dn":"Acronis+Backup+%26+Recovery+Workstation+%26+Server+v10.0.12703+with+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a93e469f69b45de2603eb2c5aac20c21141ffd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,62,70,159,105,180,93,226,96,62,178,197,170,194,12,33,20,31,253,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
