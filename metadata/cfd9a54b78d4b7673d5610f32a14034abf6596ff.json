The solution to this situation has returned access to physical Slide Zone 3, to Ascension Races, (called Aquafereion), which corresponds to Density 3 of New Earth (Ascension Earth), opening the Sala Sira Chambers from Density 2 Sirius B Edonic Temples through Sala and into our System. \n\nIncludes 3 activations that came in live during the Workshop, and that correspond to activations in the Aquafereion Shield called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Transfiguration PointsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (TFP,s) 1,2, and 3 ( first 3 of 7 TFPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s), corresponding to points in our Kristiac Time Cycles called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Birthday ChartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (and in Ecousha Centers in our bodies) that have never been activated due to the Metatronic Sextant Time Clock (creating the TimeKeeper).  These TFPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s speed up our Base Pulse Rhythms (BPRÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s), to the highest point which corresponds with that of age 33, and allows us to begin to return the ability to Transfigure our matter into Spirit, which is an essential prerequisite for Ascension.\n\nFeatures new graphs and info on what this entails, as well as a Journey which brings into our personal anatomy specific sound tones that activate the TFP Interface areas (Ecousha Centers) in our bodies.  These Activations and Journey allows us to clear the mutation in our tailbone (first of the first 8 Cells) and clear the C 60 Carbon Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bucky BallÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ floating in our Pineal Gland (Activating the 3rd Eye) allowing those Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ascension AbleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to maintain the age 33 activation level until the point of Slide into New Earth Slide Zone 3. \n\nFascinating new information on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Fetal IntegrationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and our natural Birthday Chart (our Kristiac Time Cycle).  Reaching TFP 3 Level allows the Aquafereion Shield to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“Slide Zone 3 ableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in case of an emergency.  This means we do not need a 3 day Evac, but can be pulled physically to Slide Zone 3 if the planet experiences sudden earth changes.\n\nActivation of a Hydrolase Conversion (HC) Wave during the Workshop, which the Aquafereion Shield caught and stabilized, first activates in our bodies, then we began the healing of the ocean waters, which in turn allows the waters to begin to heal us.  Allowing the elemental matter body of water to merge with its Spirit Body Counterpart creating HC, and this is connected to what is called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Solar SymbiosisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (being refueled by the sun, which is what Breatharians do).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfd9a54b78d4b7673d5610f32a14034abf6596ff","amp;dn":"The+Greatest+Love+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfd9a54b78d4b7673d5610f32a14034abf6596ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,217,165,75,120,212,183,103,61,86,16,243,42,20,3,74,191,101,150,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
