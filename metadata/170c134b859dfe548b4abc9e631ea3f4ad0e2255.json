The game would crash on certain setups during the first Age of\nKings campaign, upon finding the second relic. This is in fact a game bug\nthat can be reproduced on the original version of the game as well. Because\nwe like this game, we've patched the problem away and present you with this\ngame-related fix. The publisher is allowed to use this fix in their next\nupdate provided they remove DRM ;)\n\nBtw, for the users who expected multiplayer to work, this version has no LAN\noption. So get started writing a server emulator or pay up if you need that!\n\n--\n\n\nIn Age of Empires II: HD Edition, fans of the original game and new players\nalike will fall in love with the classic Age of Empires II experience.\nExplore all the original single player campaigns from both Age of Kings and\nThe Conquerors expansion, choose from 18 civilizations spanning over a\nthousand years of history, and head online to challenge other Steam players\nin your quest for world domination throughout the ages.  Originally developed\nby Ensemble Studios and reimagined in high definition by Hidden Path\nEntertainment, Microsoft Studios is proud to bring Age of Empires II: HD\nEdition to Steam!\n\n\n1.
