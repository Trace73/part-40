Get ready for an adventure unlike any other!\r\nA nameless hero finds himself in a mystery place between fantasy and nightmare. He doesn't remember his name nor where he comes from. Wandering through strange lands, he struggles to discover the truth about the world around him, as well as about himself. Can you escape from this dark world with plenty of devilish puzzles?\r\n\r\nThe dreamlike, nightmarish atmosphere of the game was inspired by the works of painters H.R. Giger and ZdzisÅ‚aw BeksiÅ„ski. The game's final look and feel was also strongly influenced by the universes of dark fantasy games such as Demon's Souls or Dark Seed. This unique mixture gave life to a bleak and depressing world.\r\n\r\nIf you like gory mobile adventures that sit somewhere between a hidden object game, a room escape, and a puzzler, then you're going to enjoy it. â€“ Pocket Gamer\r\n\r\nKey features:\r\nâ–ª No in-app purchases!

For fans of the genre or horror games in general, this game won't disappoint. â€“ Game Walkers (9/10)\r\n\r\nEvery single piece of art is absolutely stunning and the gameplay complements it well. It has a perfect length for what it is and the world stays with you well after youâ€™re finished. Tormentum is one of the most strikingly visual point and click adventure games and the small team at OhNoo Studio should be proud of what theyâ€™ve made. â€“ Pixel Related (9/10)\r\n\r\nIf you want a good point-and-click game with great artwork, an engaging story, this wonâ€™t take you long to get your head around, I would definitely say to give Tormentum â€“ Dark Sorrow a go â€“ Voletic (7/10)\r\n\r\nThis is simply a gorgeous point &amp; click game, with visuals that create a dark, shadowy world that oppresses you with negative emotion. This is kind of a blend of point &amp; click adventure and those hidden object search games, so the screen is always loaded with intense detail. â€“ Bluray Authority\r\n\r\nUltimately, Tormentum comes close to forming a great point-and-click adventure in 2015, but the lack of variety in the puzzle design really drags down the whole experience. â€“ GamingTrend (75/100)\r\n\r\nThe two sides have finally met in the middle! About ten years back, as adventure gaming continued to trundle along before its recent renaissance, hidden object games became a hugely popular form of â€œcasual gameâ€. â€“ Rock Paper Shotgun\r\n\r\nTormentum â€“ Dark Sorrow is a gloomy and fascinating take on the point-and-click adventure game. â€“ Game Rant\r\n\r\nVisit OhNoo Games, a developer, producer, and publisher of point and click, puzzle, adventure, casual, games!\r\n\r\nâ–¶ Like us on FB https://www. fb .com/OhNooStudio/\r\nâ–¶ Follow us on Twitter   \r\nâ–¶ Email us:   \r\nâ–¶ Learn more about OhNoo GamesÂ www.OhNoo.com\r\n*FB link not allowed in the torrent description\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new:\r\n- bugs fixed\r\n- animation improvements\r\n\r\nRequirements: Android OS 4.0 and up\r\nInstall APK.
