A light flickers dimly in the corner. Youâ€™ve created countless pieces of art, but never anything likeâ€¦this. Why havenâ€™t you done this before? It seems so obvious in retrospect. Your friends, critics, business partnersâ€”soon, theyâ€™ll all see. But somethingâ€™s still missingâ€¦\r\nYou look up, startled. That melodyâ€¦ Was that a piano? It sounded just like herâ€¦ But, noâ€”that would be impossible. Sheâ€™s gone. Theyâ€™re all gone.\r\nHave to focus. How long has it taken to get to this point? Too long, but it doesnâ€™t matter. There will be no more distractions. Itâ€™s almost finished. You can feel it. Your creation. Your Magnum Opus. \r\nDare you help paint a true Masterpiece of Fear? Layers of Fear is a first-person psychedelic horror game with a heavy focus on story and exploration. Delve deep into the mind of an insane painter and discover the secret of his madness, as you walk through a vast and constantly changing Victorian-era mansion. Uncover the visions, fears and horrors that entwine the painter and finish the masterpiece he has strived so long to create. \r\n\r\nGame Features:\r\nPsychedelic horror â€“ A sense of insanity means each turn of the camera may completely change the look of your surroundings.\r\nVictorian setting â€“ Explore a game world inspired by masterpiece paintings, architecture and dÃ©cor from the 19th century.\r\nOriginal and classic art â€“ Numerous pieces of original art and music flesh out the story and environment.\r\nStory-focused exploration â€“ Only through exploring the environment can you uncover the details of the painterâ€™s dark and tragic past.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nMINIMUM: \r\nOS: Windows 7 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core2 Quad Q8400 \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 1GB / Radeon R7 250X 1GB \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 5 GB available space \r\nAdditional Notes: Supported Gamepads: Microsoft Xbox 360 Games for Windows (Wired), Microsoft Xbox One Controller (Wired), Sony PS4 DualShock 4 controller (wired), Steam Controller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0125fc9af4dad13ceb17f00f13bbd83de351e0d1","amp;dn":"Layers.of.Fear-MERCS213","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0125fc9af4dad13ceb17f00f13bbd83de351e0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,37,252,154,244,218,209,60,235,23,240,15,19,187,216,61,227,81,224,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
