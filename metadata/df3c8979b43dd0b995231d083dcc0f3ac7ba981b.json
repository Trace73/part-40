The Eifel Tower scene is gone.  This version shows how the one missile headed for Hackensack NJ was pushed by Superman in the first movie into space and  detonated.  The explosion cracks the phantom zone and releases the 3 criminals.  In Niagra Falls, Louis and Clark are in the honeymoon suite and she fires a blank bullet, tricking Clark into revealing he is superman.  \n\nAlso this version does a much better job explaining how superman gave up his powers, goes back to his fortress of solitude, and Jor-El gives him back his powers using the green crystal.  I used a blu ray rip to convert this to a smaller mkv file to share with my fellow pirates.  Please help seed since I have limited bandwidth.
