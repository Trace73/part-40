The album features 18 single B-sides \ncollected from the preceding three Morrissey albums Ã¢â‚¬â€œ You Are the Quarry (2004), Ringleader of the Tormentors (2006),\n and Years of Refusal (2009).\nCertainly on this album class is more straightforward, Ã¢â‚¬ËœTeenage Dad on his EstateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sees Morrissey Middle England-baiting\n, eviscerating the Daily Mail reading classes for their mundane morality, their paucity of spirit, revulsion and\n ressentiment, the crowning sticker in the craw coming with the outrageous lines Ã¢â‚¬Å“despising the grin on the face of\n the boy with his methadone / heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy so leave him alone.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd indeed there are many other unproblematic Morrisseys in this collection. The Morrissey of dramatic escape,\n with whom we always wished to find a place where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quiet and dry, has us boys and girls running through glens on\n Ã¢â‚¬ËœIf You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Like Me DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Look at MeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, and on Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy Dearest LoveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shows us a wallflowered courtyard in which the \nlonely whisper to one another of love. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Knew I Was NextÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ a Christ-like boy fatalistically takes the beating from\n bullies Ã¢â‚¬â€œ reminding us of his Christian inheritance in his romanticising of suffering and his belief in its sweetly\n redemptive possibility.\n\n=============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1\tGood Looking Man About Town\t2:54\n2\tDon't Make Fun of Daddy's Voice\t2:54\n3\tIf You Don't Like Me, Don't Look at Me\t3:40\n4\tGanglord\t5:16\n5\tMy Dearest Love\t3:56\n6\tThe Never Played Symphonies\t3:03\n7\tSweetie-Pie\t4:22\n8\tChristian Dior\t3:59\n9\tShame Is the Name\t3:52\n10\tMunich Air Disaster 1958\t2:31\n11\tI Knew I Was Next\t3:47\n12\tIt's Hard To Walk Tall When You're Small\t3:32\n13\tTeenage Dad on His Estate\t4:06\n14\tChildren in Pieces\t4:01\n15\tFriday Mourning\t4:08\n16\tMy Life Is a Succession of People Saying Goodbye\t2:53\n17\tDrive-In Saturday\t5:03\n18\tBecause of My Poor Education\t3:25\n\n==================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.41 GB\nAlbum                                    : Swords\nTrack name/Total                         : 18\nPerformer                                : Morrissey\nGenre                                    : Indie / Brit-Pop\nRecorded date                            : 2009\n\n===================================================\n\nAudio\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 827 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4690ba2d191a34b96ba4a13fd6b39938ad0dbe6b","amp;dn":"Morrissey+-+Swords+%28+b-sides%29+%282009%29+Flac%5B24Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4690ba2d191a34b96ba4a13fd6b39938ad0dbe6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,144,186,45,25,26,52,185,107,164,161,63,214,179,153,56,173,13,190,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
