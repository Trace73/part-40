Now the debate is over!\n\nWhat does modern DNA research now prove about the theory that simple cells evolved into all life on earth? The answer? Simply that evolution is impossible. So why is this information being kept from the general public? Should Darwin's theories still be taught as &quot;facts&quot; in our educational institutuons?\n\nIn a wildlife program unlike any other seen before, you will journey to discover the story of life itself. This program examines the long held beliefs that have been the foundation of natural selection for more than 150 years.\n\nHow much can animals change? Why do so many species depend upon one another to survive? Where does instinct and intelligence come from? And what do the designs of creatures alive today reveal about their history?\n\nLearn about the abilities of parrot fish and dolphins, the habits of ostriches and wildebeast, and the skills and instincts of cheetahs, giraffes and lions.\n\nFilmed and researched over a five year period in more than ten different countries, Life's Story explores all these issues and many more in one of the most visually stunning and informative wildlife productions available today.\n\nThis is cd 1 of the 2 cd pack. I will upload cd 2 later on.\n\nYear of Release: 2004\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 56 mins\nMy Rating: 10/10\nQuality: 10/10 (DVDrip)\n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films/documentaries in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films/documentaries then who will?\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourselves ChristianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the Christian torrents. And please do not forget to pray for the makers of these movies/documentaries and their families. May God bless them all. \n\nPS: If you need any specific christian movie, then kindly send a mail to the below mentioned email id.
