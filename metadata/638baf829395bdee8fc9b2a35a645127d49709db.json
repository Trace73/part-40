ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s called cryptovirology, the art of turning the very methods designed to protect your data into a means of subverting it. In this fascinating, disturbing volume, the experts who first identified cryptovirology show you exactly what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re up against and how to fight back.\n\nThey will take you inside the brilliant and devious mind of a hackerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as much an addict as the vacant-eyed denizen of the crackhouseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½so you can feel the rush and recognize your opponentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power.
