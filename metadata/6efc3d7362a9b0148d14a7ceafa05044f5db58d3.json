And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good thing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Decibel Magazine\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Every second is filled with negativity, bad tidings and woe which when thrown together make one of the most oppressive sounding records I have heard in a long time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Sleeping Shaman\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Mental health is a fragile thing. One minute, birds are chirping and the sun is beaming. But that sunshine can quickly turn to despair, emptiness and aggression. Some people turn to pharmaceuticals, crime, or suicide, but fortunately, the members of GRIME chose instead to channel their suffering into music, and if you are a fan of sludgy howling insanity, then their new album Deteriorate may cure what ails youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦This album is a great example of capturing, channeling, and expelling negativity and hatred.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Invisible Oranges\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Deteriorate is an eight song chug that sounds like a train pushing through a tar pitÃ¢â‚¬Â¦From there on itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear that GRIME are pushing right into it without any relenting. Feedback and slow, crushing instruments fill every track. Every track follows in this style as though the band were pushing knee-deep through the dead.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Metal Injection\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬ËœVileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœrepulsiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ are two words that come immediately to mind after hearing this filthy slab and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure ItalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GRIME would be thrilled by that. They obviously set out to make one hateful chunk of sludge/doom here and they succeeded at that.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Doommantia\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With this album the Italian sludge-meisters have delivered filth-laden journey into the ugliest recesses of humanity. This sure ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pretty; it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t pound you into the ground, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll drag you in feet first and screaming.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Lair of Filth\n\nA few minutes in the universe of these guys and you will scream in a high-pitch/growl voice Ã¢â‚¬Å“SLUDGEEEEEE!!!!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Oh my fuckinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ godÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ This is exactly what we fans of old-school sludge needed. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ CVLT Nation\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦dirty-as-fuckÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pure Grain Audio\n\nIf you like it GO BUY IT !!!\ngrimeofshit dot bigcartel dot com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6efc3d7362a9b0148d14a7ceafa05044f5db58d3","amp;dn":"Grime+-+Deteriorate+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6efc3d7362a9b0148d14a7ceafa05044f5db58d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,252,61,115,98,169,176,20,141,20,167,206,175,160,80,68,245,219,88,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
