Fortunately, New YorkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up and coming popstar Grace Danger has the perfect song to take us all home, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Me Like ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the End of the World.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n12/21/12 is the last day on the Mayan calendar, and if that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t startling enough, we recently realized our desk calendars all stop at December 31st this year as well, so things are looking pretty bleak.\nYou can either fear the end, or you can blow it out with a bang. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Me Like ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the End of the World,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ votes for the latter. With a radio-ready hook, and the vocal chops to back it up, the appropriately named Grace Danger throws caution to the wind and bets it all on tonight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f33713145646df33c323356b5354c6ede5c39ee","amp;dn":"Love+Me+Like+It%27s+the+End+of+the+World+%28original+song%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f33713145646df33c323356b5354c6ede5c39ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,51,113,49,69,100,109,243,60,50,51,86,181,53,76,110,222,92,57,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
