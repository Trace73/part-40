When I heard that she could do that, and carry a melody, I was like holy crap, we gotta get that whistling into a song as soon as possible. Ximena Sarinana is an extremely talented singer, and performer from Mexico. We co wrote this song Ã¢â‚¬Å“DifferentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, for her 2011 album. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking forward to writing more music with her someday soon.\n \n \nTim Timebomb-Vocals, Guitar, Percussion\nKevin Bivona-Guitar, Bass, B3, Percussion\nJohn Morrical-Piano\nJordis Unga-Background Vocals, Whistle\nAimee Interrupter-Background Vocals\nMark Bush-Trumpet\nRuben Duranz-Trombone\nRobby Spengler-Tenor Sax","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5925d67473f81439a6857d45db7ca93558ebdb8a","amp;dn":"Different+-+Tim+Timebomb+and+Friends.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5925d67473f81439a6857d45db7ca93558ebdb8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,37,214,116,115,248,20,57,166,133,125,69,219,124,169,53,88,235,219,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
