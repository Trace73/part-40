Notwithstanding that, it came out very well. The songs where Neil is sitting and playing guitar are excellent. Love in Mind and A Man Needs A Maid are shot from behind. Full video on those, but it's dark. The upright piano songs (AYRFTC?, Someday, Gold Rush, Journey) were tough to get. Mostly just audio, though the filmer tried to get whatever possible. The stand-up guitar songs (Changes, Needle of Death, Comes A Time, Long May You Run) are mostly pretty good. All in all, it's a nice document from this mini tour. There are some obstructions and partial obstructions throughout as people moved around. If you're a Neil fan you'll enjoy this. \n\nThis mini tour is part of Neil's Honor The Treaties campaign. I won't share my opinion, but I encourage everyone to be educated about the issues. \n\nEnjoy!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24e137f293e16bccf2d7b18855b730a27b126572","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+Massey+Hall+-+Toronto%2C+ON+January+12%2C+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24e137f293e16bccf2d7b18855b730a27b126572","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,225,55,242,147,225,107,204,242,215,177,136,85,183,48,162,123,18,101,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
