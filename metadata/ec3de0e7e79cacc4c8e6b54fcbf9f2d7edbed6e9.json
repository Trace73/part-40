However, this willingness to try new things alienated him from mainstream music listeners, and it wasn't until after his death that his musical legacy was fully appreciated. This is his debut LP, a '60s gem, and how it all started back in 1966. have fun!\n\nTrack Listings:\n\n1. I Can't See You\n2. Wings\n3. Song Of The Magician\n4. Strange Street Affair Under Blue\n5.

Understand Your Man\n\n\nReview by Richie Unterberger\n\nBuckley's 1966 debut was the most straightforward and folk-rock-oriented of his albums. The material has a lyrical and melodic sophistication that was astounding for a 19-year-old.\n\nThe pretty, almost precious songs are complemented by appropriately baroque, psychedelic-tinged production. If there was a record that exemplified the '60s Elektra folk-rock sound, this may have been it, featuring production by Elektra owner Jac Holzman and Doors producer Paul Rothchild, Love and Doors engineer Bruce Botnick, and string arrangements by Jack Nitzsche. \n\nThat's not to diminish the contributions of the band, which included his longtime lead guitarist Lee Underwood and Van Dyke Parks on keyboards.\n\nBuckley was still firmly in the singer-songwriter camp on this album, showing only brief flashes of the experimental vocal flights, angst-ridden lyrics, and soul influences that would characterize much of his later work. It's not his most adventurous outing, but it's one of his most accessible, and retains a fragile beauty.
