Its dying crew set the AI on automatic to defend the smashed rubble of their planets. Throughout the lonely centuriesÃ¢â‚¬â€goes the legendÃ¢â‚¬â€the faithful vessel continued to patrol the empty battlefield, obeying its last order.\n\nIn the here and now, Earth needs a miracle. Out of the Beyond invade the New Men, stronger, faster and smarter than the old. Their superior warships and advanced technology destroy every fleet sent to stop them. Their spies have infiltrated the government and traitors plague EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s military.\n\nCaptain Maddox of Star Watch Intelligence wonders if the ancient legend could be true. Would such an old starship be able to face the technology of the New Men?\n\nOn the run from killers, Maddox searches for a group of talented misfits. He seeks Keith Maker, a drunken ex-strikefighter ace, Doctor Dana Rich the clone thief stuck on a prison planet and Lieutenant Valerie Noonan, the only person to have faced the New Men in battle and survived to tell about it.\n\nMaddox has to find a place hidden in the Beyond and bring back a ship no one can enter. If he fails, the New Men will replace the old. If he succeeds, humanity might just have a fighting chance...\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab50dc12af6e13cf13559925ec8ec7dc87d512fa","amp;dn":"Vaughn+Heppner+-+The+Lost+Starship+%28The+Lost+Starship+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab50dc12af6e13cf13559925ec8ec7dc87d512fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,80,220,18,175,110,19,207,19,85,153,37,236,142,199,220,135,213,18,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
