In this collection Brenda presents 23 accessories and toys, featuring furry monsters, carnivorous plants, killer robots, and menacing tiki figures. While there are some literal monsters in the bunch--toys and amigurumi--a majority of projects are wearable accessories and garments.\n\nSome projects, such as a robot-themed intarsia blanky, are aimed specifically at children, while many others are for adults and teens who want to have a little fun.\n\nBrenda shows how to tackle all the sewing and appliquÃƒÂ© techniques required in her patterns, including how to install zippers, as well as subtle tricks for achieving personality in your critters with a section on &quot;The Principles of Cuteness.&quot; Beastly Crochet is a book that is as fun to read as it is to crochet from!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f440c9e798d9b45777c138657e5f8993f8d046af","amp;dn":"Beastly+Crochet%3A+23+Critters+to+Wear+and+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f440c9e798d9b45777c138657e5f8993f8d046af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,64,201,231,152,217,180,87,119,193,56,101,126,95,137,147,248,208,70,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
