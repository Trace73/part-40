Evans (due to a misunderstanding) sits out on much of &amp;quot;Stan's Blues,&amp;quot; and there are two trio features without the tenor but otherwise the other seven numbers match Getz with Evans, bassist Eddie Gomez, and drummer Marty Morell. Although released under the pianist's name, this CD is very much Stan Getz's show and his beautiful tone sounds quite exquisite on &amp;quot;But Beautiful,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Emily,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Peacocks,&amp;quot; and the swinging &amp;quot;You and the Night and the Music.&amp;quot; This historic and somewhat unique release has many enjoyable moments.\n\n\nTracks\n\t1 \t  \tGrandfather's Waltz \tFarnlof, Lees \t7:45\n  \t  \t2 \t  \tStan's Blues \tGetz, Gryce \t5:32\n  \t3 \t  \tBut Beautiful \tBurke, VanHeusen \t5:26\n  \t \t4 \t  \tEmily \tMandel, Mercer \t5:26\n  \t  \t5 \t  \tLover Man \tDavis, Ramirez, Sherman \t7:50\n  \t  \t6 \t  \tFunkallero \tEvans \t6:18\n  \t \t7 \t  \tPeacocks \tRowles \t6:47\n  \t  \t8 \t  \tYou and the Night and the Music \tDietz, Schwartz \t7:24\n  \t  \t9 \t  \tSee-Saw \tColeman \t6:22\n  \t  \t10 \t  \tTwo Lonely People \tEvans, Hall \t7:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebf4538665ca3c0ac2995a49381e5bcf2e09c38a","amp;dn":"JAZZ-+Bill+Evans+-+But+Beautiful+%28ftr+Stan+Getz%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebf4538665ca3c0ac2995a49381e5bcf2e09c38a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,244,83,134,101,202,60,10,194,153,90,73,56,30,91,207,46,9,195,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
