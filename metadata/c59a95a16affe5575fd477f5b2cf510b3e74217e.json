If you're adding the torrent via magnet link, you can deselect any undesired file in the list of files once the torrent has begun downloading.\n========================================================\n\n\nThe Human Rocket returns!\nYou've followed him through the history making (and changing!) AvX and now the mystery of the all-new Nova are revealed in this breathtaking new ongoing by the best-selling, award winning team of Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness (RED HULK, Avengers X-Sanction).\nSam Alexander is a kid bound by the gravity of a small town and a father whose ridiculous, drunken fairy tales about a &quot;Nova Corps&quot; were just another heavy burden in a life full of them. But luckily for Sam Alexander...soon gravity won't even matter. And those troubles? It's like they're a billion miles away.\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59a95a16affe5575fd477f5b2cf510b3e74217e","amp;dn":"Nova+01+%282013%29+%287+Covers+1440%2B2048px-HD%29+%28Tarutaru-Novus%29+%5BNVS-D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59a95a16affe5575fd477f5b2cf510b3e74217e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,154,149,161,106,255,229,87,95,212,119,245,178,207,81,11,62,116,33,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
