Here Page believes she is in love with both Daredevil and Murdock, and Nelson with Karen Page, resulting in a silent rivalry between the two men. The supervillains the Owl and the Purple Man are the antagonists. In this story, Daredevil credits Page with coining the phrase &quot;The Man without Fear&quot;, and she also suggests to Daredevil he wear red instead of black and yellow.\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cd86e09e22153eadfb35e6627e43300dfe9935a","amp;dn":"Daredevil+Yellow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cd86e09e22153eadfb35e6627e43300dfe9935a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,216,110,9,226,33,83,234,223,179,94,102,39,228,51,0,223,233,147,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
