A weblog is a journal that is frequently updated \nand intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally represent \nthe personality of the author or the Web site. \n \nOk, so what about pinging? Originally, a ping was a program that bounced a request off \nof another computer/server over a network or the Internet to see if the remote computer \nwas responding. That same program is now used as a method of informing others that \nyour blog exists and also letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s them know when a new post has been made.  \n \nWhen you put the two together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ blogging and pinging Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you get a technique that is \nextremely effective at getting ANY web site, no matter how big or small, indexed by the \nmajor search engines.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6998803d595cfb5341f698197b65a8486e55459b","amp;dn":"The++BLOG+AND+PING++TUTORIAL+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6998803d595cfb5341f698197b65a8486e55459b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,152,128,61,89,92,251,83,65,246,152,25,123,101,168,72,110,85,69,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
