Some of the experiments \nwork surprisingly well (&quot;Inside The Mystery&quot;moreÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦ effectively contrasts funky, danceable verses with a stately guitar-driven midsection), \nbut others fall flat. For instance, the bouncy keyboard pop that drives &quot;The System&quot; does not sit well with its hard-edged cynical lyrics. \nThe rockers at the songs that work best on Free Spirit: &quot;Brown Eyed Boy&quot; is a punchy hard-rocker built on hard-driving drumwork from Deep Purple&amp;#039;s \nIan Paice and &quot;Telephone&quot; draws much strength from a well-judged combination of poppy background vocals and chugging guitar riffs. \nThe ballads, usually a highlight of Hensley&amp;#039;s work, also work nicely on this album: the best example is &quot;Woman,&quot; which contrasts moody keyboard-driven \nverses with pulsating, guitar-fuelled instrumental breaks. All in all, Free Spirit&amp;#039;s lack of a coherent style will probably turn off the casual \nlistener but there are enough strong, well-produced tracks on this album to make it a worthwhile listen for any fans of Hensley or Uriah Heep.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98666a07e485c2280cafbc7809e6ae93132a91dd","amp;dn":"Ken+Hensley%28uriah+heep%29-Free+Spirit+1981","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98666a07e485c2280cafbc7809e6ae93132a91dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,102,106,7,228,133,194,40,12,175,188,120,9,230,174,147,19,42,145,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
