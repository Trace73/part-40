In unfashionable Chelsea lies the Asterisk Club, a refuge for murderers who have wrongfully been cleared by the courts of their crimes. Newly released Benji Cann attempts to find refuge there, but the club is full. By chance, the house next door has a vacant room to let, and Benji takes up residence there. Next morning, his landlady finds him dead - poisoned.\n\nDid her husband do it? She brings her high camp dancer friend in to help dispose of the body, only for chaos - and a second dead body - to follow.......\n\nAll very silly, but good fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af4c59dffa93d22b5c13050e4945e148e21669d3","amp;dn":"Wooden+Overcoat+-+Radio+Comedy+Thriller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af4c59dffa93d22b5c13050e4945e148e21669d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,76,89,223,250,147,210,43,92,19,5,14,73,69,225,72,226,22,105,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
