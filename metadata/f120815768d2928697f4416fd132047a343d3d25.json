Finding episode numbering has not been an easy task. Cross referencing various sites, I believe this to be S01E04.\n\n------\n\n\nSHOW DETAILS:\n\nJapanizi: Going, Going, Gong!\nContestants compete with a teammate against other teams as they tackle obstacles and challenges to test their mental capabilities, strength, endurance, and smarts.\n\nJapanizi is an adaptation of the ABC reality show I Survived A Japanese Game Show. The studio-based kids game show will make use of zany costumes, conveyor belts, dizzy chairs, giant fans and velcro walls with themed competitions and more.
