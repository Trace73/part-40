Their musical roots came from listening to the early rhythm and blues acts. The music most often associated with the band is beach music, frat rock, R&amp;B, or shaggin&amp;#039; music. After a few years of touring colleges from the Carolinas to the Louisiana Bayou, John McElrath took the group to Arthur Smith&amp;#039;s Studio in Charlotte North Carolina, to record &quot;Double Shot (of My Baby&amp;#039;s Love)&quot;. The song became a million seller in 1966, and has been a party classic for college students for decades. &quot;She Drives Me Out Of My Mind&quot; and &quot;Hey, Hey, Baby&quot; were top 40 hits in 1966 and 1967, but &quot;Double Shot&quot; remains the signature song of the Swingin&amp;#039; Medallions.\n\n\n\nSwingin&amp;#039; Medallions-Double Shot-The Anthology\n@192-kbps\n\n\n\ntrack list\n\n\n01-Double Shot Of My Babys Love\n02-She Drives Me Out Of My Mind\n03-Hey Hey Baby\n04-I Want To Be Your Guy\n05-Lonely Drifter\n06-Come Back Girl\n07-You Gotta Have Faith\n08-Night Owl\n09-M.T.Y.L.T.T.\n10-What Kind Of Fool \n11-Hang On Sloopy\n12-Louie, Louie\n13-Wooly Bully\n14-I&amp;#039;m Gonna Make Her Mine\n15-Barefootin&amp;#039;\n16-Willie Don&amp;#039;t Play That Saxophone\n17-Shaggin&amp;#039; In The Moonlight\n18-The Boys Are Back In Town","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:322ae747b261b81c19b0e95ff5e10aed3372209d","amp;dn":"The+Swingin%5C%27+Medallions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"322ae747b261b81c19b0e95ff5e10aed3372209d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,42,231,71,178,97,184,28,25,176,233,95,245,225,10,237,51,114,32,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
