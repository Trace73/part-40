The children and the teacher, calm and peaceful by nature, when driven beyond their limits by the kidnappers, eventually respond with a cruelty and fury extending that of their oppressors. \n\nIn this movie, A group of crazed Aussie group of thugs, kidnap a group of students in a school house and hold them hostage. A movie, with a plot that doesn&amp;#039;t look promising at first, manages to stabilized itself with all the suspense. It maybe isn&amp;#039;t the best of movies, but all the thrills, and chills are all in the right place, and it isn&amp;#039;t such a bad movie to watch.\n\nResolution: 576x416\nFramerate: 23.976\nLength: 1 hour 27 minutes 56 seconds\n\nVideo codec: XVID\nVideo bitrate: 1039kbps\n\nAudio codec: MP3\nAudio bitrate: 64kbps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6de01fe1ce518c7d104f3d33f6b86a6a6ccaea4","amp;dn":"Fortress+%281986+TV+movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6de01fe1ce518c7d104f3d33f6b86a6a6ccaea4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,222,1,254,28,229,24,199,209,4,243,211,63,107,134,166,166,204,174,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
