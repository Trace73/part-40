It is the third entry in the Populous video game series, developed by Bullfrog Productions in 1998. The PC version of the game was released November 30, 1998 and a PlayStation version was later developed and released on April 2, 1999. Unlike earlier games in the series, which cast the player in the role of a god influencing loyal followers, The Beginning took a radical departure and placed the player in the role of a shaman, who directly leads her tribe against opponents. Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.&quot;\n- Wikipedia\n\nClassic game. Graphics, handling and gameplay is a bit outdated for sure, but the fun is definitely not obsolete!\n\nTorrent by JR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffc16dcf228fc0ba622f85c272d897de94c578a1","amp;dn":"Populous","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffc16dcf228fc0ba622f85c272d897de94c578a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,193,109,207,34,143,192,186,98,47,133,194,114,216,151,222,148,197,120,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
