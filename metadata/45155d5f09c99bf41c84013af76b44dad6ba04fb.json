On the first piece, Lasse FÃƒÂ¤rnlÃƒÂ¶f's &quot;Grandfather's Waltz,&quot; Lien's harmonies reference Bill Evans' version. Jerome Kern's &quot;Look For The Silver Lining&quot; and Billy Strayhorn's &quot;Chelsea Bridge&quot; foreground the trio's by now intuitive interplay and, though minimalist, get deep into the essence of the melodies.\nThe covers of Freddie Hubbard's &quot;Little Sunflower,&quot; Wayne Shorter's &quot;Penelope,&quot; Carla Bley's &quot;Ida Lupino,&quot; Tony Williams' &quot;Love Song&quot; and Hampton Hawes' &quot;Sonora&quot; feature the trio as colourful interpreters. &quot;Little Sunflower&quot; is shaped by AalefjÃƒÂ¦r's idiosyncratic sonic palette, while the haunting &quot;Penelope&quot; is performed as a modern piece with dark arco bowing by Berg. The deliciously lyrical &quot;Ida Lupino&quot; receives a minimalist interpretation that references the composer's own impressionistic recordings, and the deceptive simplicity of the moving waltz, &quot;Love Songs,&quot; touches lightly on Herbie Hancock's exploration of the tune. Another waltz, &quot;Sonora&quot; is more understated than Hawes' own versions of the piece.\nTwo surprising inclusions are a playful and lighthearted version of Joseph LeCalle and Albert Gameses' pop song &quot;Amapola,&quot; and an impeccably performed spin on Hans Eisler's beautiful and optimistic &quot;To The Little Radio&quot; (possibly better known now as &quot;The Secret Marriage,&quot; after Sting set new lyrics to the melody).
