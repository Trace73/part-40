With three of those number ones having occurred this year the wave of popularity he is currently surfing seems to show no signs of subsiding. Following his recent dual signing to two of Armada's flagship trance labels - Perfecto Fluoro and Armind Simon has also showcased incredible versatility as a producer. With production styles ranging from the massive hit with vocalist Lucy Pullin &quot;The One&quot; through to his twisted psychedelic productions on Perfecto Fluoro (including his remix of Neelix &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; and his recent collab with Spanish breaks maestro Blazer - &quot;Contraband&quot;). Now Simon turns his attention to his second compilation album of the year. Following on from London Clubbing institution The Gallery's Eighteenth Birthday album, which Simon contributed a mix for, he now takes things dark, dirty and twisted for Paul Oakenfold's underground trance label Perfecto Fluoro. Full on Fluoro, Vol. 1 is the first in a new series of albums that will focus on supporting the underground side of trance, as well as Breaks and Progressive Psy and will feature Fluoro regulars, allowing them to flex their DJ muscles in a 2 hour, non stop mix.\n\n          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.beatport.com/release/full-on-fluoro-vol-1/1185297&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.beatport.com/release/full-on-fluoro-vol-1/1185297&lt;/a&gt;\n \n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
