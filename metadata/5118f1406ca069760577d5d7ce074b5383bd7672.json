The concept album built on ideas explored by the band in their live shows and earlier recordings, but it lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their work following the departure in 1968 of founding member, principal composer, and lyricist Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\n\nThe album was developed as part of a forthcoming tour of live performances, and it premiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨red several months before studio recording began. The new material was further refined during the tour and was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesisers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews with staff and band personnel provided the source material for a range of philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible for some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album, including the non-lexical performance of Clare Torry.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard 200 for one week. It subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988, longer than any other album in history. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered by several other acts. It spawned two singles, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Us and Them&quot;. In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular albums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest rock albums of all time.\n\nRead much much more on Wikipedia\n\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nReleased: 10 March 1973\nRecorded: June 1972 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ January 1973, Abbey Road Studios, London\nGenre: Progressive rock\nLength: 42:59\nLabel: Harvest / Capitol\nProducer: Pink Floyd\n\n\nVinyl Ripping Log\nNitty Gritty RCM 1.5\nTechnics SL-1200MK2 Turntable with KAB Fluid Damping and KAB record grip\nOrtofon 2M Black cartridge\nPro-Ject Tube Box SE II Preamp\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nBias Peak LE 6 recording software\niZotope RX Advanced 1.21 for Redbook conversion\nxACT 1.71 for Redbook SBE correction\n\nRCM&gt;TT &gt; Ortofon 2M Blk&gt; Tube Box preamp&gt; ADC&gt; Mac Pro Dual Xeon&gt; Peak LE @ 24/96 &gt;\nanalyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset, each side maximized to -0.3 dB) &gt;\nsplit into individual Tracks &gt; Click Repair 3.02 used in Manual Mode, 30 Rev, Pitch Protection, X2 &gt;\nFLAC encoded Level 8 with XLD Version 20100302 (116.6)\n\nAll de-clicking software used in full manual mode to preserve musical transients.\nNo music was harmed in the making of this vinyl rip.\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original track layout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPink Floyd - Dark Side of The Moon (30th Anniversary Edition 180g vinyl)\n\nI do not know who the author of this is so I couldn't ask for permission.\nBut I'm sure he didn't ask Pink Floyd for permission either :D\n\n\n= + = + = + = + = + = + = + = + = + = + =  \nThe four building blocks of the universe \nare fire, water, gravel and vinyl. \n~Dave Barry \n= + = + = + = + = + = + + = + = + = + = +\n\n\nAuthors Comments:\n----------------\nI've heard quite a few vinyl rips of DSOTM and I still felt there was something more this format has to offer.

I haven't done the rip myself but decided to upload it to demonoid since there's only a flac 16bits version on this site. The quality is good and it's worth downloading if you're a fan of this album, at least just for the experince of listening this particular version.\n\n\nEquipement used:\nRecorded at 24/96 there is no post processing whatsoever - what you hear is what is on the vinyl. This is an excellent copy but even after cleaning there are still one or two clicks and pops. Feel free to remove them if you want - they do not bother me.\n\nAs usual before converting this excellent copy to FLAC the record was cleaned on a Loricraft Pro cleaning machine using L' Art du Son cleaner. It was transcribed on an SME20/2 turntable with SME V arm and Koetsu Rosewood Platinum Signature cartridge to a Krell KPE reference phono amp and on to a Steve Huntley modified Audio Research LS22 tube pre amp. The ADC was an e-mu 0202 and the sound was captured on Audition 2. All cables are Grover Silver reference. Monitoring was via an Audio Synthesis DAX Discrete DAC, Krell FPB400cx power amp and Wilson Benesch speakers with Velodyne DD-10 sub-woofers.\n\n\nGot it somewhere else, posted here.
