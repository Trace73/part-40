How do innovators manage to spot the opportunities for industry revolution that everyone else seems to miss?\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, innovation is not some mystical art that s forbidden to mere mortals. The Four Lenses of Innovation thoroughly debunks this pervasive myth by delivering what we ve long been hoping for: the news that innovation is systematic, it s methodical, and we can all achieve it.\r\n\r\nBy asking how the world s top innovators Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, and many others came up with their game-changing ideas, bestselling author Rowan Gibson identifies four key business perspectives that will enable you to discover groundbreaking opportunities for innovation and growth: * Challenging Orthodoxies What if the dominant conventions in your field, market, or industry are outdated, unnecessary, or just plain wrong? * Harnessing Trends Where are the shifts and discontinuities that will, now and in the future, provide the energy you need for a major leap forward? * Leveraging Resources How can you arrange existing skills and assets into new combinations that add up to more than the sum of their parts? * Understanding Needs What are the unmet needs and frustrations that everyone else is simply ignoring?\r\n\r\nOther books promise the keys to innovation this one delivers them. With a unique full-color design, thought-provoking examples, and features like the 8-Step Model for Building a Breakthrough, The Four Lenses of Innovation will teach you how to reverse-engineer creative genius and make radical business innovation an everyday reality inside your organization.\r\n\r\nRowan Gibson has done a superb job of unpacking what it takes to innovate.

And this book is the manual.
