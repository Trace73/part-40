Drenched in warmth and endless space, the opening moments of 'Eye Contact' creep in with mid-tempo, half-electroid pads so deep and joyous that the remaining 50 minutes of the album seem to pass before they begin. 'Moonlight Rendezvous' is so retro and so crisp that even those of you who didn't follow the Detroit scene will feel nostalgic for it. The standout track, however, has got to be 'Let me Be Me' - with the vocal refrain of 'Let me be what I wanna be' and a dark, electroid squelch so tight and unforgettable you'll have it etched to your brain for weeks. One of our all-time favourite albums - a must.\n\nFull Album + Bonus: sunday night live at the laptop cafe EP\n\nTime:64min 01sec\nsize: 93.7mb\nbitrate:192kbps\n\ntracklist: \n\n1. the other people place - eye contact (5:29)\n2. the other people place - DÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©jÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ Vu (7:30)\n3. the other people place - moonlight rendezvous (7:06)\n4. the other people place - you said you want me (4:23)\n5. the other people place - let me be me (7:45)\n6. the other people place - running from love (5:49)\n7. the other people place - lifestyles of the casual (5:28)\n8. the other people place - sunrays (8:15)\n9.
