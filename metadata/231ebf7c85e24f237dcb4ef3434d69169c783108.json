Boogie Dell is the one and only Dell Richardson of Radio Caroline fame and owner of Fury Records. In those early days the place was un- licensed and you could not purchase alcohol only listen to music.\n\nFor many, a band is usually associated with a singer and in the late Nigel Dixon Whirlwind not only had a great singer but an extremely photogenic front man. In Mick Lewis, who had been introduced to rockabilly after seeing his mate Lemmy (yes, the Lemmy who later went on to Motorhead fame) playing with his band at a local venue, Whirlwind  had one of the hottest rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll guitarists Britain has ever produced. Phil Foghorn Hardy (Foghorn due to his hollering and shouting whilst playing) was the man on the skins who gave the back-beat to the band in those developing days of the 1970s, when Revival rockÃ¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll was in its infancy. The line up was completed by bass player Chris Emo.\n\n\n1 Hang Loose \n\n2 Boppin' High School Baby \n\n3 My Bucket's Got A Hole In It \n\n4 My Advice \n\n5 A Thousand Stars \n\n6 One More Chance \n\n7 Don't Be Crazy \n\n8 Rockin' Daddy \n\n9 Slow Down \n\n10 Blue Moon Of Kentucky \n\n11 Together Forever \n\n12 Who's That Knocking \n\n13 Tore Apart \n\n14 Do What I Do \n\n15 Ducktails \n\n16 I Only Wish \n\n17 Midnight Blue \n\n18 Teenage Cutie \n\n19 You Got Class \n\n20 Honey Hush \n\n21 Cruisin' Around \n\n22 Stay Cool \n\n23 Running Wild\n\n24 Okie's In The Pokie \n\n25 Heaven Knows \n\n26 Big Sandy \n\n27 Such A Fool \n\n28 Nightmares \n\n29 If It's All The Same To You \n\n30 Stayin' Out All Night ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:231ebf7c85e24f237dcb4ef3434d69169c783108","amp;dn":"Whirlwind+-+In+The+Studio+-+1995+%5BRockabilly%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"231ebf7c85e24f237dcb4ef3434d69169c783108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,30,191,124,133,226,79,35,125,203,78,243,67,77,105,22,156,120,49,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
