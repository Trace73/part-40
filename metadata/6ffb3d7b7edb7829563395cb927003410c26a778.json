In this, her first memoir, the beloved and award-winning television actress reflects on the role that made her famousÃ¢â‚¬â€Rhoda Morgenstern on the groundbreaking series The Mary Tyler Moore Show and on the spin-off show RhodaÃ¢â‚¬â€and the pressures of helming her own sitcom, Valerie.

This is a delightful read. Enjoy.&quot;\n\nRosie O'Donnell\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I, Rosie,loved I, RHODA, Valerie Harper's wonderful new book full of heart and Hollywood, friends and family. I have loved Val since I first saw her standing on Mary's balcony.Her amazing career and her beautiful life are woven together with grace and wit.&quot;\n\nCloris Leachman\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Valerie is brilliant, frigging talented, funny as hell, warm, generous...and her book is a HIT! Detailed, delightful, and deliciousÃ¢â‚¬â€I've found myself starting to read it again!&quot;\n\nEd Asner\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am a law-abiding, God-fearing Orthodox Jewish boy, and Valerie Harper is a wanton, out of control, nihilist who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure never thought of God unless his name was on a contract. I thought I knew this wastrel of an actress, but it turns out I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know a thing about her! A regular Jo, she worked her ass off to develop every aspect of her great talent, be it as a twinkle-toed tapper or a fantastic comedic actress with equal dramatic chops. Valerie is a pisser and you gotta read her book!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJulie Kavner\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Valerie writes in a straight-forward style that is honest and funny and true. I know because I was there during the Rhoda years. It was great fun to relive the moments I was honored and lucky enough to be a part of. I also got to learn things about Valerie I never knew. What a marvelous life and what a wonderful read.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ffb3d7b7edb7829563395cb927003410c26a778","amp;dn":"Valerie+Harper+-+I%2C+Rhoda+%5B96%5D+Unabridged+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ffb3d7b7edb7829563395cb927003410c26a778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,251,61,123,126,219,120,41,86,51,149,203,146,112,3,65,12,38,167,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
