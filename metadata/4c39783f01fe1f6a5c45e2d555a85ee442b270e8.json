It chronicles the lives and sacrifices of those men as well as the Bibles they produced. This book shows the hand of God on the translators throughout the 16th century as they risked their lives to get the Word of God to the common people. Many of whom were burned at the stake for their part in the translating the Bible. Thus leading to the number one selling book of all time, the blessed King James Bible!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nBob Walker is an evangelist based out of Larned, Kansas.
