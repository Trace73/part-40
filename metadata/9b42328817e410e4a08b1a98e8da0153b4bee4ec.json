I repeat the ascent. Pardon\n\n2 CDs PCM (WAV)\nYES Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe\nEvening of Yes Music Plus \n\nREVIEW If the title to this double-disc live set seems a little, er, roundabout, it's not just you. This material\nwas drawn from the Anderson/Bruford/Wakeman/Howe tour in 1989, a group that was contractually barred from using the\n&amp;quot;Yes&amp;quot; moniker -- thus the reference to Yes Music (the &amp;quot;plus&amp;quot; most likely refers to the ABWH material). Mixing classics\n(&amp;quot;Starship Trooper,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Close to the Edge&amp;quot;) with their recent material (&amp;quot;Order of the Universe,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Brother of Mine&amp;quot;) is\na mixed bag, and the solo sections are purportedly less than thrilling, so proceed with caution before picking this\none up. You have to wonder why they didn't release material from the Union tour instead, since by all accounts that\nwas a real hoot. Note that a promotional EP containg four tracks from this release was issued by Herald in the US,\ncalled An Evening of Yes Music... Plus Promo.\n\nTRACK LISTING\n\n\nDISC 1: \n  1.
