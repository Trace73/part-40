With Eye, Parsons returned in some ways to his more progressive, art-rock past and the album only had one major hit, the lush title track. Parsons's approach was a synthesis of studio wizardry with a symphonic, spacey interplay between keyboards, synthesizerss and basic rock instrumentation. Though never a hit, &quot;Psychobabble&quot; remains a favorite of fans. &quot;Children of the Moon,&quot; &quot;Sirius,&quot; and &quot;Gemini&quot; all have Parsons's love of the esoteric. &quot;Mammagamma&quot; also allowed Parsons to fully indulge his fondness for orchestration with its instrumental structure.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2713559493_c7da62aa1c.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://farm4.static.flickr.com/3079/2713559493_c7da62aa1c.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
