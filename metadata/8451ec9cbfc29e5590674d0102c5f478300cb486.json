An up-and-coming property agent is desperate to make his mark in life and believes you have to spend money in order to make it. The only problem is that he is spending a lot more than he is making, driving the flashy car and trying to outdo the neighbours. This extravagant lifestyle gets him into trouble with loan sharks and, through a series of mishaps, in trouble with the law. He gets sentenced to 200 hours of community service at an old-age home. There he meets a grumpy old man who spent his life chasing money and now finds himself miserable and alone. Their story is a comic clash of cultures spiced up with hard-hitting life lessons. There's also a chance for love with a woman who has a totally different value system.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8451ec9cbfc29e5590674d0102c5f478300cb486","amp;dn":"Nothing+For+Mahala+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8451ec9cbfc29e5590674d0102c5f478300cb486","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,81,236,156,191,194,158,85,144,103,77,1,2,197,244,120,48,12,180,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
