The American public has something they should call Republican Manufactured Crisis Fatigue Syndrome. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of hard to get worked up over a problem that would disappear if people just act rationally. The problem is that some of those people have to be Republicans.\n\nRepublicans tend to take most of the blame whenever thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a government shutdown. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s because, without Republicans, there never would be a government shutdown. Hello! If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fire, the first person you blame is the know pyromaniac. Something burned down? Chances are itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that guy who is always lighting matches and giggling.\n\nLindsey Graham says that he would be willing to support revenue increases as part of a sequester deal. Uh Lindsey, just because youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the biggest nut on Benghazi doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean the Tea Party is giving you permission to make sense on the sequester.\n\nA group of prominent Republicans has signed a legal brief to the Supreme Court in support of gay marriage. Technically, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called an amicus brief, or a Ã¢â‚¬Å“friend-of-the-courtÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ brief. Heck, most Republicans would refuse to sign that just because it sounds gay. The people signing this brief are friends of the court, AND friends of Dorothy. The brief cites previous Supreme Court decisions, including Citizens United. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the law for youÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re promoting something right using the logic employed to do something else wrong.\n\nIn Colorado, a gun nut has been arrested for sending harassing and threatening emails to a state representative who is working on gun control.  One of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emails threatened the rep and another lawmaker by using Gabbie GiffordsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ name. He wrote Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hopefully somebody Gifords both your asses with a gun.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ And he misspelled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Giffords.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Amazing!  He made up a termÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and he still managed to misspell it. How hard is that?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93942c50eed775a6b22c8d49779240aaaacbd006","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+February+26+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93942c50eed775a6b22c8d49779240aaaacbd006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,148,44,80,238,215,117,166,178,44,141,73,119,146,64,170,170,203,208,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
