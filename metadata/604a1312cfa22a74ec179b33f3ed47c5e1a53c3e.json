A pioneer and true spirit of the scene \nwhose enthusiasm, passion and drive to push forward and make it better is    \namazing. He is an inspiration.                                                \nThe album consists of 3 cd&amp;#039;s of what Raja Ram sees as the key tracks of his  \ncareer in music which spans 40 years!. His favourite moments.                \nCD1 is Quintessence and what a great collection it is. Really groovy stuff.  \nSome amazing jazz flute by Raja Ram and great guitar solos and tunes. A really\ngreat collection of tracks from a legendary band in the London Psychedelic    \nmovement of late 60&amp;#039;s early 70&amp;#039;s.                                            \nCD2 is The Infinity Project. Raja Ram and Graham wood were one of the first  \nacts to make Goa Trance or Psy Trance as it is now known. There first track  \nwas in 1989 and they had the first Tip party to celebrate it. Both the track  \nand the flyer of the party are included in package. This is the definitive    \ncollection of T.I.P as selected by Raja Ram but mixed together.              \nCD3 the final cd is also mixed and is mainly Shpongle, Raja Ram&amp;#039;s very        \nsuccessful partnership with Simon Posford who have really pushed the          \nboundaries of what Psychedelic music can be. Then we have of course some key  \ntracks from the other highly successful collaboration (Riktam, Bansi and      \nChicago) which is1200 Micrograms. One of the key global acts this decade for  \nhigh power, peak time Psy music. A real headliner for all the big Psy parties \naround the world.                                                            \nAnd we have Cyberbabas first track which was the first time Raja Ram got      \ntogether with Benji Vaughan and what an exciting collaboration of talent they \npossess. In fact the next chapter is a new act by these 2 called The Zap! And \nit is perhaps Tip Worlds most exciting album to date. Psychedelic but        \ngenerally pretty genre defying stuff. Elements from everywhere but not        \nconstrained by any rules and routines, speeds, sounds or effects. Watch out!  \nRaja Ram has only just begun!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:604a1312cfa22a74ec179b33f3ed47c5e1a53c3e","amp;dn":"%5BPSYCHEDELIC%5DVA_-_Raja_Ram_The_Anthology-3CD-2007-BY_CHAKS.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"604a1312cfa22a74ec179b33f3ed47c5e1a53c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,74,19,18,207,162,42,116,236,23,155,51,243,237,71,197,225,165,60,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
