This is from one of the greatest sea stories ever, MOBY DICK, authored by Herman Melville .\r\nMoby Dick is only one of the many tales told about giant creatures that live in the sea. The raging waves of the sea and the dark depths they hide have always fired human imagination, and there are countless myths, across the world, of giant creatures that live in the seas. And all of them are not just fiction, as the vast seas really have beings huge beyond our imagination.\r\nThis issue of Tell Me Why tells about the giants of the sea, and their magical world.\r\n \nhttp://s24.postimg.org/5kv5ww5fp/Giants_of_the_Sea_Tell_Me_Why_113.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6424a45482fce24a8166df86767386043932bf9","amp;dn":"Giants+of+the+Sea+%28Tell+Me+Why+%23113%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6424a45482fce24a8166df86767386043932bf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,66,74,69,72,47,206,36,168,22,109,248,103,103,56,96,67,147,43,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
