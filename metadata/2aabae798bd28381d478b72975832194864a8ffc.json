Faster-than-light travel has only recently become a reality, and the World Space Authority is still learning how to manage long-range missions safely. To make matters worse, efforts to prepare two planets for colonization are killing off native life-forms, outraging people on Earth.\r\n \r\nSo thereâ€™s not a lot of demand for space pilots. Priscilla thinks her career may be over before it has begun. But her ambition wonâ€™t be denied, and soon she is on the bridge of an interstellar ship, working for the corporation that is responsible for the terraforming.\r\n \r\nHer working conditions include bomb threats, sabotage, clashes with her employersâ€”and a mission to a world, adrift between the stars, that harbors a life-form unlike anything humanity has ever seen. Ultimately, she will be part of a life-and-death struggle that will test both her capabilities and her character...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Tavia Gilbert\r\nLength: 11 hrs and 57 mins \r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps \r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:11-05-13\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aabae798bd28381d478b72975832194864a8ffc","amp;dn":"Jack+McDevitt+-+Starhawk+%28The+Academy+%237%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aabae798bd28381d478b72975832194864a8ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,171,174,121,139,210,131,129,212,120,183,41,117,131,33,148,134,74,143,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
