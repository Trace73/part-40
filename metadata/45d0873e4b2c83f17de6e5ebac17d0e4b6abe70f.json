He learned to play the Delta blues at the feet of Robert Johnson himself, who happened to be Lockwood's common-law stepfather. Decades later, an octogenarian Lockwood is still applying the lessons he learned from the master with great alacrity, as evidenced by I Got To To Find Me A Woman. Though he was schooled in the acoustic country blues, which he can still tear off like nobody's business, Lockwood learned early on that electricity was a blues guitarist's best friend, and began taking a few tricks from the Chicago blues book.\n\nBoth sides of that fence are represented here, as Lockwood performs affecting solo numbers alongside full-band Chicago-style stompers. His solo reading of the Delta standard &quot;Walkin' Blues&quot; showcases his sinuous guitar style, while the steady pumping of such tunes as &quot;Big Legged Woman&quot; shows Lockwood to be an authoritative interpreter of fully-charged electric blues. Naturally, it doesn't hurt to have people like Joe Louis Walker and B.B. King pitching in, either.\n\n\nTracklist\n1 Walking Blues 2:38 \n2 Take a Little Walk with Me 3:34 \n3 Little Boy Blue 3:25 \n4 Feel Like Blowing My Horn 4: 31\n5 I Got To Find Me A Woman 6:06 \n6 She's Little and She's Low 5:37 \n7 Big Legged Woman 4:35 \n8 Lockwood's Boogie  2:23 \n9 My Daily Wish 8:51 \n10 How Long, How Long Blues3:02 \n11 Kindhearted Woman Blues 2:40 \n12 Every Day I Have the Blues 4:22 \n13 Bob and B.5:11 \n14 For You My Love 3:11\n\nPersonnel: \nRobert Lockwood, Jr. (vocals, guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, 12-string guitar, slide guitar); \nCharles &quot;D.C.&quot; Carnes, Joe Louis Walker, B.B.
