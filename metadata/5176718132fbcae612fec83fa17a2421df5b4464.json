Renowned artist of the dark fantastic Victoria Frances first made a splash in the U.S. with her dreamy, sensual paintings in the Favole trilogy. Now, Frances returns with a gorgeous storybook for all ages. The tale of little Parisian boy Sasha and his poignant misadventures is at once heartwarming and melancholy, combining a sweetly gothic story with arresting, beautifully painted illustrations.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTruly, a beautiful book. And yeah, it's all-ages, but it's the kind of book that would give some kids nightmares. I wish I had books like this when I was a kid.\n\nAlso, Misty Circus has a great website... if you speak Spanish or French. Now that the book has been translated to English lets hope the create the same option for the website.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5176718132fbcae612fec83fa17a2421df5b4464","amp;dn":"Misty+Circus+Vol+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5176718132fbcae612fec83fa17a2421df5b4464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,118,113,129,50,251,202,230,18,254,200,63,161,122,36,33,223,91,68,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
