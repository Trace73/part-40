Amore &amp; Larry D. Shinn\nCategory: Religion/Mythology, Fiction\nPublisher: Oxford University Press Inc (May 14, 1981)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0195028384\nISBN-13: 978-0195028386\n\nThis collection of tales from Hindu and Buddhist texts is presented in a clear, easy-to-read style and is a terrific collection, for those familiar with the original stories and those with no background or experience with them at all. Both authors recount the tales with all the (sometimes lurid) details intact. A great primer on many of the most interesting Eastern folklore and mythology that each of the two religious traditions have to offer.\n\nReviews:\n&quot;A marvellous introductory text, well-organized and clearly written. The renditions of stories are readable and engaging.&quot; -Edward T. Gilday, Bowdoin College\n\n&quot;A delicious repast of stories, delightfully told and intended to satisfy our narrative appetites and nourish our moral sensibilities. Drawing upon tales from the Hindu epics, the PaÃƒÂ±catantra, Puranas, Jatakas, Nikayas, and other texts, the authors provide translations and summaries of stories illustrating fundamental Hindu and Buddhist values and attitudes....A good candidate for use in undergraduate courses in Indian religions or the introduction to religion.&quot;-Religious Studies Review\n\nThis torrent contains an excellent fully indexed, browesable and searchable PDF copy that is retail quality. The front cover image is also included.
