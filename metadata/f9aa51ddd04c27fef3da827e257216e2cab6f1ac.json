Strategy is paramount to success; careful skill management, equipment selection and magic usage will win your fights, not rapid button clicking. We are very pleased to say this is not another Ã¢â‚¬Å“action RPGÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery. A combination of randomly generated treasure and carefully hidden goodies means that no two games will play the exact same way.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ Unlimited character development style: Choose from 24 unique skills to make the character you want and 8 base attributes that affect your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s every action throughout the game. The game world does not scale or adjust itself to match anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s play style, so the ease or difficulty of the game is directly related to how successful you are at developing your character.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ Combat plays out at your pace. Eschalon: Book I features a turn-based system that allows you to roll through combat as fast or slow you wantÃ¢â‚¬Â¦make it fast and furious, or analyze every option for maximum advantage.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ A non-linear storyline means that the game world is open to explore as you desire. Follow the storyline or donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ¢â‚¬Â¦itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to you. Just be careful where you go and who you choose to trust- the world of Eschalon can be a deadly place for an inexperienced adventurer.\n\nÃ¢â„¢Â¦ An epic adventure that you must face aloneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦a single-player RPG carefully designed to feel like the great old school RPGs of the past such as UltimaÃ‚Â®, Might &amp; MagicÃ‚Â®, and WizardryÃ‚Â®","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9aa51ddd04c27fef3da827e257216e2cab6f1ac","amp;dn":"Eschalon%3A+Book+I+%5BDRM+Free%5D%5Breseed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9aa51ddd04c27fef3da827e257216e2cab6f1ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,170,81,221,208,76,39,254,243,218,130,126,37,114,22,226,202,182,241,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
