Thirteen-year-old Jack goes to the City to find his fortune, unaware that the City is in fact Toy City, where legends and fables walk (or stumble, if they&amp;#039;ve had too much to drink). He meets up with detective teddy bear Eddie, who is investigating the murder of Humpty Dumpty. When Little Boy Blue is offed, it&amp;#039;s clear that a serial killer is prowling Toy City, leaving behind the titular chocolate bunnies as his calling card. Rankin doesn&amp;#039;t just drop names of familiar characters but gives them riotous back stories: Miss Muffett hosts a daytime TV talk show called &quot;The Tuffet&quot;; Mother Goose (who prefers to be called Madame Goose) runs a brothel; Humpty Dumpty was likely a failed television stuntman named Terry Horsey. Although the story is wickedly clever and the payoff is a great and satisfying surprise, the real delight comes from watching Rankin work his linguistic magic: characters talk in hilariously circular and self-aware dialogue, and puns and wordplay are packed into the prose like sardines in a tin. Although substantially darker and edgier than the Hitchhiker&amp;#039;s series, this gem will appeal to Douglas Adams fans, as well as lovers of British humor in general. \nCopyright Ã‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
