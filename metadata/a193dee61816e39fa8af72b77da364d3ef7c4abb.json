It tells the dystopian story of a teenage boy Alex, his violent and unlawful lifestyle, the effort of the state to reform him and henceforth the consequences.\n\nThe title is taken from an old Cockney expression, &quot;as queer as a clockwork orange&quot;, and alludes to the prevention of the main character's exercise of his free will by the positively conditioned responses to evil feelings. Written from the perspective of a seemingly biased and unapologetic protagonist, the novel also contains an experiment in language: Burgess creates a new speech that is the teenage slang of the not-too-distant future.\n\nThe novel has been adapted for Cinema by Stanley Kubrick and Andy Warhol, adaptations have also been made for television and the stage. As well as inspiring a concept album, the novel and films are referred to in, and have inspired, a number of songs.\n\n\nRipped from 6 Cd's.\nUnabridged.\nRead By Tom Hollander.\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n==================================================================================\nFOR DIRECT DOWNLOADS ON A HUGE SELECTION OF AUDIOBOOKS, WHICH ARE UPDATED DAILY VISIT: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://audiobooks-download.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;\n==================================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a193dee61816e39fa8af72b77da364d3ef7c4abb","amp;dn":"A+Clockwork+Orange+-+Anthony+Burgess+%5BUnabridged%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a193dee61816e39fa8af72b77da364d3ef7c4abb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,147,222,230,24,22,227,159,168,175,114,183,125,163,100,211,239,124,74,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
