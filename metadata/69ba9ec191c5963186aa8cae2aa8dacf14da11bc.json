Reinvigorated by a stint in rehab, South African-born vocalist/guitarist Shaun Morgan, whose singing often recalls that of Metallica's James Hetfield, has an enthusiastic intensity that's evident on the swaggering &quot;Fake It&quot; and the urgent &quot;6 Gun Quota,&quot; making for one of Seether's most lively albums.\n\nSeether: Shaun Morgan (vocals, guitars); Dale Stewart (bass guitar); John Humphrey (drums).\n\nAdditional personnel: Space (guitars); Howard Benson (keyboards, programming).\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69ba9ec191c5963186aa8cae2aa8dacf14da11bc","amp;dn":"Seether-Finding_Beauty_In_Negative_Spaces-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69ba9ec191c5963186aa8cae2aa8dacf14da11bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,186,158,193,145,197,150,49,134,170,140,174,42,168,218,207,20,218,17,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
