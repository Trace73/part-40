Ka-Zar appearances in the 1970s include a reprint series, KA-ZAR #1-3, a &quot;split-book&quot; feature (with Dr. Doom!) in ASTONISHING TALES, #1-20 a.k.a. all the Ka-Zar issues, and the almost-immediate follow-up series, KA-ZAR: LORD OF THE HIDDEN JUNGLE #1-20. Please seed and share!  --STFmaryville\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nKevin Plunder, the 2nd Ka-Zar started as a similar character to the 1st, but reminiscent of both Tarzan and of writer-artist Joe Kubert's 1950s caveman character, Tor. Created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in The X-Men #10 (March 1965), he lives in the dinosaur-populated Savage Land, which was hidden beneath Antarctica by extraterrestrials.\n\nOriginally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the &quot;Lord of the Savage Land&quot;, a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.\n\nHe has had four self-titled series (1970Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1971; three issues, mostly reprints), 1974-1977 (20 issues) by Mike Friedrich, 1981-1984 (Ka-Zar the Savage, 34 issues) by Bruce Jones and Mike Carlin, and 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by Mark Waid.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9424d29a4601cc01397bd6fcc9096ac8723db2c","amp;dn":"KA-ZAR+%281970-1977%29+Including+ASTONISHING+TALES+01-20+%28REQUEST%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9424d29a4601cc01397bd6fcc9096ac8723db2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,66,77,41,164,96,28,192,19,151,189,111,204,144,150,172,135,35,219,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
