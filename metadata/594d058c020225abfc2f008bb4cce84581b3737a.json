Almost 181 minutes.\r\n(some audience patching)\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a very good balanced professional board tape from house mix.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. The Song Remains The Same \r\n02. The Rover intro / Sick Again \r\n03. Nobody's Fault But Mine \r\n04. In My Time of Dying \r\n05. Since I've Been Loving You \r\n06. No Quarter \r\n\r\nDisc 2: \r\n01. Ten Years Gone \r\n02. Battle of Evermore \r\n03. Going to California \r\n04. Dancing Days \r\n05. Black Country Woman \r\n06. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp \r\n07. White Summer/Black Mountain Side \r\n08. Kashmir \r\n\r\nDisc 3: \r\n01. Out On the Tiles intro / Moby Dick \r\n02. Jimmy Page Solo \r\n03. Achilles Last Stand \r\n04. Stairway to Heaven \r\n05. Whole Lotta Love \r\n06. Rock and Roll\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nAnother strong accent. Since I've Been Loving You is very powerful, \r\nNo Quarter an epic and Ten Years Gone is also excellent. A great, \r\nshort, impromptu version of Dancing Days leads into Black Country \r\nWoman. Moby Dick for drum solo fans is over 35 minutes long here! \r\nSo sad Jimmy not goes deeper into Communication Breakdown but only \r\nteasing the audience with a riff","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:594d058c020225abfc2f008bb4cce84581b3737a","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.05.26+Landover%2C+Maryland+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"594d058c020225abfc2f008bb4cce84581b3737a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,77,5,140,2,2,37,171,252,47,0,139,180,204,232,69,129,179,115,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
