But they're the same generals we know in name only: their appearance, personality, and gender are all different. One day, first Oda Nobunaga and then all the others are transported to our world. Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e89382fc7f7ec53cdf22329d7f3602981f09b7f","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+26+%5B1080p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e89382fc7f7ec53cdf22329d7f3602981f09b7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,137,56,47,199,247,236,83,205,242,35,41,215,243,96,41,129,240,155,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
