As to be expected from music conceived in such a remote location, both the landscape and Sami culture looms large over Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ã…Â¡ogÃƒÂ¡ttis. JannokÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high, transparent voice swoops deliciously above the accompaniment, but she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just sing melodies Ã¢â‚¬â€ with her distinctive vocal decoration she employs her voice like an instrument.\n\nWith some lush string arrangements and arching anthems (especially the trance-like Ã¢â‚¬ËœIreneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) it is tempting to compare Sofia and her band with Sigur Ros, but similarities are actually pretty thin on the ground. JannokÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key external influence is jazz and her music is naturally introspective and harmonious rather than grand or soaring. The Peter Tikkanen Trio lend firm support with low-key riffs and improvisations, adding a layer of funkiness to tracks like Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒï¿½rvasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœGolle MÃƒÂ¡zeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nJannok composed most of the music on Ãƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ã…Â¡ogÃƒÂ¡ttis. Although a couple of her folk-pop melodies lack sparkle, she crafts songs with great skill. Title track Ã¢â‚¬ËœÃƒï¿½Ã…Â¡Ã…Â¡ogÃƒÂ¡ttisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has a stillness that builds and ebbs, echoing the passionate lyrics (beautifully translated for those of us not familiar with Nordic languages) and sweet-toned love song Ã¢â‚¬ËœLiekkasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ conveys the happiness of being warm inside while it is bitterly cold out.\n\nFinal track Ã¢â‚¬ËœDulla LullabyeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, fuses a beguiling traditional folk tune with JannokÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrics (A small childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream / is whiter than the snow / The wind on the tundra / starts singing for you), which, together with a poised trumpet solo interlude, brings home the nostalgic innocence of this music and sends a shiver down the spine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be02d9e07a9bbb765673848f5fb6bbfd5bc31fd9","amp;dn":"Sofia+Jannok+-+Assogattis+%28by+the+embers%29+%5B2008%5D+%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be02d9e07a9bbb765673848f5fb6bbfd5bc31fd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,2,217,224,122,155,187,118,86,115,132,143,95,182,187,253,91,195,31,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
