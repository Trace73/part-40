Banished for their troubles to the starship Newhope, they now face a bold future: to settle the worlds of Barnardâ€™s Star. Now King Bascal Edward de Towaji Lutui, former prince of the Queendom of Sol, together with Captain Xiomara â€œXmaryâ€ Li Weng and her lover, first mate Conrad Mursk, face a perilous voyage with thousands of their fellow exiles. The journey will last a century, but with Queendom technology itâ€™s no problem to step into a fax machine and â€œprintâ€ a fresh, youthful version of yourself. But what this crew of rebels will find is far from the paradise they seek. Before long, their optimistic young colony has started to show signs of strain. And worst of all, death itself has returned with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 96 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9309d8ec86019031277b2fed47d7bf78a6c50209","amp;dn":"Wil+McCarthy+-+Lost+in+Transmission+%28The+Queendom+of+Sol+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9309d8ec86019031277b2fed47d7bf78a6c50209","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,9,216,236,134,1,144,49,39,123,47,237,71,215,191,120,166,197,2,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
