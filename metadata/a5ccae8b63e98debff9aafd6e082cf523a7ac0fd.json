Actually,\nJames had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had\ncome of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away\nto join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to\nToronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo\nSpringfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with\nGoldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds,\nthey signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was\never released. James had a journeyman's career playing\nbass in various groups before signing again to Motown as\nan artist, songwriter, and producer..\n\nAfter an eight-year stay at Motown, Rick James moved to\nReprise/Warner Bros. with 1988's LP &quot;Wonderful&quot;. By that\ntime, the funkster wasn't nearly as popular as he had been\nin the late 70s and early 80s, and he hoped to make a major\ncomeback with this album. Now incorporating pop/rock, synth\nfunk, and hip-hop elements this wax right here features\nalbum's title in five, kind of bugged out, electro funk\nversions remixed by the likes of Paul Simpson, Dave Shaw\nand Bruce Kane.
