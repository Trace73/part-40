With his porcelain skin, golden eyes, mesmerizing voice, and supernatural gifts, Edward is both irresistible and impenetrable. Up until now, he has managed to keep his true identity hidden, but Bella is determined to uncover his dark secret. What Bella doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t realize is the closer she gets to him, the more she is putting herself and those around her at risk. And, it might be too late to turn back ...\n---\nWhen Edward leaves Bella, her whole world is turned upside down. With Bella's heart broken, she turns to Jacob, her best friend, to fill the void that was left by Edward. As Bella spends more time with Jake, she learns that there's more than vampires in the town of Forks.\nIMDb Links...........:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365675/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365675/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259571/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1259571/&lt;/a&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAbout three things I was absolutely positive:\nFirst, Edward was a vampire.\nSecond, there was a part of him--and I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know how dominant that part might be--that thirsted for my blood.\nAnd third, I was unconditionally and irrevocably in love with him.\n\n\nThis series gets too much hate.  Yes, the characters are overblown and the story is convoluted.  Yes, Bella doesn't act like a normal teenager, but point out a 'normal teenager' for me and I'll drop this argument right now.  But despite all the flaws, this is still a great novel series and the films are FUN.  The first film is no where near as good as the second, and the third coming out soon to theaters actually has the most potential for being really good.  But overall, the films are still great entertainment when compared to the Reality TV that's being pumped at us nonstop ...\n\nNow, I used the EXACT same Twilight.mp4 file as I previously uploaded and even let the original torrent do a hash-check.  In fact, I'm actually uploading to BOTH torrent files simultaneously.  If you HAVE the first torrent, I ask that you help out by uploading the first film while downloading the second.  It will make the torrent move that much quicker.  I've even put the New Moon.mp4 into the same folder, which will make things that much easier.\n\nBasically, this is just an updated torrent with the second film added.  If all goes well and this torrent stays seeded, then next year I'll probably end up updating it again for Eclipse.  I also decided NOT to post any trivia up for these films, mostly because fans of the series know most of the trivia anyway.  And yes ... that last screen shot is from the very, very end when Bella is finally speechless.  \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nScreen Shots\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o168/VixenofVenus/ScreenShots/twilight01.jpg&quot;
