BlazBlue runs on an embedded windows XP arcade system, which means that after a bit of ingenuity it can be run on windows PCs of comparable/higher specs.\n\nTo configure the game, drag &quot;game.exe&quot; onto &quot;typex_config.exe&quot;\nAnswer no to the first 3 questions, and on the fourth just press enter. Then configure your inputs.\nTo run the game, drag &quot;game.exe&quot; onto &quot;typex_loader.exe&quot;\nThis process can be simplified by making a simple shortcut/batchfile\n\nIf you're having trouble configuring your controls, unplug any USB joypads/sticks before running typex_config.exe\n\nIf your settings aren't saving, you can translate the japanese text to english by going to data/ETC/Text and rename the &quot;eng&quot; folder &quot;jap&quot; and the &quot;jap&quot; folder &quot;eng&quot;\n\nIf the game is running slowly, try installing some replacement backgrounds:\nhttp://www.uploadmirrors.com/download/ON9VLUPB/BG%20Replace%202.zip\n\nIf your D drive isn't writeable and you want to change your operator menu\nsettings, use this launcher. It will reassign your D drive to Z, and assign your BBCS folder to the D drive. It will change everything back when you quit the game.\n\n\n\nI tested it on Vista 64 bit with a ps2 controller and it worked fine!\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f0bdab060ce67201eddfde9894f07461711975","amp;dn":"BlazBlue+Continuum+Shift+pc+repack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f0bdab060ce67201eddfde9894f07461711975","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,240,189,171,6,12,230,114,1,237,223,222,152,148,240,116,97,113,25,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
