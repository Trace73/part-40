If anybody is able to upload the DVD of the Documentary it would be hugely appriciated!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeslie Feist (born 13 February 1976), known professionally as simply Feist, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and is a member of the indie rock group Broken Social Scene. At the 2008 Juno Awards in Calgary, she was the top winner with five awards, including Songwriter of the Year, Artist of the Year, Pop Album of the Year, Album of the Year and Single of the Year.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754146/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754146/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeist's new documentary Look at What the Light Did Now is a humble and impressionistic chronicle of the making of her modern classic, The Reminder. The film highlights the visual and sonic collaborators that amplified her music and vision in the studio and on tour, including music video director Patrick Daughters (who did &quot;1234&quot; and &quot;I Feel It All&quot;), photographer Mary Rozzi (who shot the album cover), and shadow puppet artist Clea Minaker (who designed and executed onstage projections during The Reminder tour). Running with the &quot;amp&quot; analogy, Feist herself warns in the film: &quot;You play through the wrong amps and you end up sounding like Dire Straits.&quot; Too true.\n\nThe DVD-- which comes with a 13-track CD of live songs and Reminder covers by Gonzales-- is out today in Europe and tomorrow, December 7, in North America. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/40906-feist-talks-ireminderi-documentary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/40906-feist-talks-ireminderi-documentary/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Look At What The Light Did Now (Solo)\n02 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Limit To Your Love\n03 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ When I Was A Young Girl\n04 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ My Moon My Man\n05 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Secret Heart\n06 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Strangers\n07 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ So Sorry\n08 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Where Can I Go Without You\n09 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Intuition\n10 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Water\n11 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Sea Lion Woman\n12 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ 1234\n13 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Look At What The Light Did Now (Duet With Little Wings)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.listentofeist.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.listentofeist.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28singer%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_%28singer%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/40906-feist-talks-ireminderi-documentary/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/news/40906-feist-talks-ireminderi-documentary/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754146/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754146/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0baecfd738b2c60aa69ad78d7b7f404eee483c7","amp;dn":"Feist+-+Look+At+What+The+Light+Did+Now+%282010%29%28OST+Soundtrack%29%28In","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0baecfd738b2c60aa69ad78d7b7f404eee483c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,186,236,253,115,139,44,96,170,105,173,120,215,183,244,4,238,228,131,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
