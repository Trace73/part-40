The series developed from La jeunesse de Spirou (1987), a Spirou et Fantasio album in which Tome and Janry (at the time the authors of the series) set to imagine Spirou's youth. It was developed into a spin-off series shortly afterwards and the authors have focused on it ever since the controversy created after their final Spirou et Fantasio album, Machine qui rÃƒÂªve (1998). New albums are among the bestselling French-language comics, with 330,000 copies for the latest one.[1]\n\nIn addition to continuing to develop the character in the spirit of previous Spirou et Fantasio author Franquin, in this series Tome and Janry paid homage to Franquin's manner of animating the gag's signature.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0fed506eb1ed179a5f53e23b5106fb90fb41d11","amp;dn":"Petit_Spirou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0fed506eb1ed179a5f53e23b5106fb90fb41d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,254,213,6,235,30,209,121,165,245,62,35,181,16,111,185,15,180,29,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
