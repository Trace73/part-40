In the artwork the cd's scans are missing.\n\nArthur Stewart (Art) Farmer (August 21, 1928 in Council Bluffs, Iowa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ October 4, 1999), was an American jazz trumpeter and flugelhorn player. He also played flumpet, a trumpet/flugelhorn combination designed for him by David Monette.\nHis identical twin brother, Addison Farmer was a bassist.\n\nBenny Golson (born January 25, 1929) is an American bebop/hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist, composer, and arranger.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
