Maybe thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why my plans didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out. Cold could never describe what I feel for Drake Gallagher. Still, after ten years of bitterness, ten years of hiding in the shadows, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s any way to bridge the distance between us. Especially now.\n\nRunning away seemed to be the best answer. So what am I supposed to do now that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found me again? Is it time to open up and tell himÃ¢â‚¬Â¦everything? The safest thing to do would be push him away. But safety is an illusion. Nobody knows that better than I.\n\n2014 | ASIN: B00GX3ZZ30 | 70 pages | EPUB, MOBI | 0,6 MB \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c84fdc43765217de7f387fcea209417bf58cd91f","amp;dn":"%5BJ.Dallas%5DThe+Virgin+Redemption%28EPUB%2C+MOBI+%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c84fdc43765217de7f387fcea209417bf58cd91f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,79,220,67,118,82,23,222,127,56,127,206,162,9,65,123,245,140,217,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
