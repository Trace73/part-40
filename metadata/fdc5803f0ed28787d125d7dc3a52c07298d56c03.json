The first such requirement is that they implement the language, and so ISO/IEC 14882:2011 also defines C++. Other requirements and relaxations of the first requirement appear at various places within ISO/IEC 14882:2011.\n\nC++ is a general purpose programming language based on the C programming language as specified in ISO/IEC 9899:1999. In addition to the facilities provided by C, C++ provides additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management operators, and additional library facilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc5803f0ed28787d125d7dc3a52c07298d56c03","amp;dn":"Official+Standard+C%2B%2B0x+C%2B%2B11+CPP+CXX+ISO%2FIEC+14882%3A2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc5803f0ed28787d125d7dc3a52c07298d56c03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,197,128,63,14,210,135,135,209,37,215,220,58,82,192,114,152,213,108,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
