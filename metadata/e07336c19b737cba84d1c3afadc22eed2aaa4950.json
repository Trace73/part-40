With a readership of 46.6 million adults, People has the largest audience of any American magazine.[3] People had $997 million in advertising revenue in 2011, the highest advertising revenue of any American magazine.[4] In 2006, it had a circulation of 3.75 million and revenue expected to top $1.5 billion.[ It was named &quot;Magazine of the Year&quot; by Advertising Age in October 2005, for excellence in editorial, circulation and advertising.[6] People ranked #6 on Advertising Age's annual &quot;A-list&quot; and #3 on Adweek's &quot;Brand Blazers&quot; list in October 2006.\n\nThe magazine runs a roughly 50/50 mix of celebrity and human-interest articles.a[Ã¢â‚¬Âº] People's editors claim to refrain from printing pure celebrity gossip, enough to lead celebrity publicists to propose exclusives to the magazine, and evidence of what one staffer calls a &quot;publicist-friendly strategy&quot;.\n\nPeople's website, People.com, focuses exclusively on celebrity news. In February 2007, the website drew 39.6 million page views &quot;within a day&quot; of the Golden Globes. However &quot;the mother ship of Oscar coverage&quot; broke a site record with 51.7 million page views on the day after the Oscars, beating the previous record set just a month before by the Golden Globes.[not in citation given]\n\nPeople is perhaps best known for its yearly special issues naming the &quot;World's Most Beautiful People&quot;, &quot;Best &amp; Worst Dressed&quot; and &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot;. The magazine's headquarters are in New York and it maintains editorial bureaus in Los Angeles and in London. Due to economic reasons it closed bureaus in Austin, Miami, and Chicago in 2006\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07336c19b737cba84d1c3afadc22eed2aaa4950","amp;dn":"People+-+5+May+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07336c19b737cba84d1c3afadc22eed2aaa4950","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,115,54,193,155,115,124,186,132,209,195,175,173,194,46,237,42,170,73,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
