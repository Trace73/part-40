The new Expanded Second Edition of A Bardon Companion is in print!\n\nThis second edition contains an entirely new in-depth commentary upon Initiation Into Hermetics and a large collection of excerpts from my public and private correspondence.  I've also reproduced the complete text of the original 2002 first edition and have supplied a full index.  In total, the expanded second edition of 2010 is 520 pages in length -- over twice the material presented in the first edition!  It is a hefty book, weighing in at 2 lbs and with a size of 6&quot;x9&quot;x1.2&quot;!  LOL\n\nSince my usual publisher was unable to afford such an expensive print run, I have opted to publish this second edition myself, using an internet based on-demand publisher (CreateSpace.com) and selling the paperback version through Amazon.com.  And now, due to persistent demand, I am offering the new Second Edition in digital eBook format below.
