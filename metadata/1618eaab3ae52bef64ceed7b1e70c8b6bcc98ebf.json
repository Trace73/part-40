Somehow the folks at Reprise were either diplomatic enough with a \nsatisfactory aesthetic approach or had a big enough checkbook to satisfy the \nartist's concerns (and this writer is willing to believe it was the former). A \nvaried cast of pioneers from electronica's vast frontier was assembled by \ncompilation producers Stefan Rambow and Norman Rudnitzky. The first two cuts are \nthe most obvious. There's Apollo 440's &quot;The Man With the Harmonica,&quot; mixed out \nof the soundtrack for Once Upon a Time in the West. There are layers and layers \nof keyboards extrapolating the melody -- and parts of it -- with dub effects and \nlarge, deep drums and sequencers. It's pleasant enough, but it's predictable, a \nno-brainer, and so much could have been done with it that one has to wonder why \nsuch a reverent reading. Terranova's reading of &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; is \ncompletely forgettable -- I literally can't remember it (let's play it \nagain...yawn...forgot) -- in the second slot, so things don't reach high simmer \nuntil Fantastic Plastic Machine's edited remix and rewarp of &quot;Belinda May&quot; from \nthe film The Alibi. Producer and mixologist Tomoyuki Tanaka adds three layers of \nBrazilian percussion and vocals to the Latin rhythmic and melodic qualities of \nthe original, turning it into a heavenly hash of good vibes, killer string \nswells, and dubbed out, echoplexed, rhythmic samba throb. The two DJs from \nRockers Hi-Fi turn in separate remixes of the &quot;Clan of the Sicilians&quot; theme. The \ntwo readings are radically different; DJ Dick's is the better of the two, with a \ntropical feel added to the already exotic soundscape painted by the composer, \nlayering funky flutes and an additional foreground set of harmonized (synth) \nstrings. Bigga Bush's remix is more minimal, fielding an additional layer of \ntripled percussion and stripping back the melody by adding chords to frame the \ndrums. Other standouts include Thievery Corporation's take on the &quot;Il Grand \nSilenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§io&quot; opening theme. It's a downtempo mix with shimmering string glissandi \naugmented by the late-night chill-out effect of spare snares and cymbals, and a \nminimally pulsing keyboard riff playing the changes; it sets the mood and keeps \nit tight with Morricone's original melodic intent. Also quite fine is the \nNightmares on Wax redo of &quot;Chi Mai,&quot; taken from the 1971 film Magdalena. His \napproach is very spare, but extremely effective, and it sounds as much like a \ntrademark Nightmare on Wax creation as it does Morricone's original, adding a \nreggae rhythm section to underlie the strings and a chunky but skeletal set of \nlayered keyboard chords playing in harmony with Morricone's strings. What could \nhave been one of the biggest exercises in modern kitsch has instead turned out \nto be a viable, listenable, and mostly wonderful set of tracks that pay a worthy \nhomage to a maestro. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
