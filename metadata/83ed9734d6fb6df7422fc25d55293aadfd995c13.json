But no, they haven&amp;#039;t bit the mud and made a graceful return on Wordpress. Well, now we should ask ourselves whether it will ever rise again. Maybe they will return some place else, but until then let&amp;#039;s take a break and think about all those trip-hop bands you wouldn&amp;#039;t have heard (of) if it wasn&amp;#039;t for this great blog. Even I admit I&amp;#039;ve made quite a few interesting, unexpected discoveries. What we got here? Over an hour of some of the best trip-hop stuff that was presented on this blog (from both Wordpress and Blogspot eras). Long live trip-hop music.\n\n\ntracklisting:\n1.
