But the bandmembers were inventive, rabid rock fans who turned conventions inside out, melding punk and indie guitar rock, classic pop, surf rock, and stadium-sized riffs with singer/guitarist Black Francis' bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture; while the meaning of his lyrics may have been impenetrable, the music was direct and forceful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b8898257e6f43b9794877a74a812b5bede630e9","amp;dn":"Pixies+-+EP2+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b8898257e6f43b9794877a74a812b5bede630e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,136,152,37,126,111,67,185,121,72,119,167,74,129,43,91,237,230,48,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
