There was an album of re-recorded work, showing Richmond FontaineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Portland roots in hardcore; an internet-only live set; and a novel, The Motel Life, which read like a prose version of one of his songs, following two losers round Reno as they waited for their luck to change. \n\nAs the laureate of the lost, the lonely, and the rootless, Vlautin was never likely to stand still, and while there is no dramatic change in the texture of his lyrics, the geography has altered. VlautinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s drifters are still skirting the borders of oblivion, but their tales unfold against a desert backdrop. On ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGhost I BecameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, he sends this stark postcard: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesert dreams/Always sunny/And never grey/No noise/Just wind and sage.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nThe words are spare, but the sound has expanded. Recording in Tucson, Arizona, producer JD Foster drafted Giant SandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Howe Gelb (piano on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ$87 And A Guilty Conscience That Gets Worse The Longer I GoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) and CalexicoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Joey Burns and Jacob Valenzuela. The widescreen sound, with the melancholy mists of Paul BrainardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pedal steel cooling CalexicoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Mexican spaghetti stylings, is a surprise after The Fitzgerald. Sometimes it masks the blunt beauty of VlautinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s storytelling, but it can also add a noirish sheen: ValenzuelaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s gorgeous trumpet on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Kid From Belmont StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ turns a maudlin song into a shimmering pulp opera. \n\nVlautin has been inspired by his surroundings, and there are at least two classics. The closer, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLost In This WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (with Burns on piano) is worthy of early Tom Waits, though VlautinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s voice displays vulnerability where Waits offers beat-up defiance. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSt Ides, Parked Cars, And Other PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s HomesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is little more than a short poem, and Vlautin almost talks the words. But when he gets to the part about ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfuck-ups, hanging on in our own wayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, you know, as ever, heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not faking. \n\nALASTAIR McKAY\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ccd47856021dac291bc0121c3d4f8f62f3b762e","amp;dn":"Richmond+Fontaine...Thirteen+Cities%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ccd47856021dac291bc0121c3d4f8f62f3b762e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,205,71,133,96,33,218,194,145,188,1,33,195,212,248,246,47,59,118,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
