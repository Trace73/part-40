This time Max and Stacy discuss error accounts and accounting 'errors,' like misplacing $700 million or finding $78 billion. Only GIABOzilla can save the day! \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max Keiser interviews James Howard Kunstler about political awakening that an absence of justice could turn into a new Jacobin style uprising.\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 in the torrent is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.
