At the age of 14, the death of his father stopped Billings' formal schooling. In order to help support his family, young Billings trained as a tanner. He possibly received musical instruction from John Barry, one of the choir members at the New South Church, but for the most part he was self-taught. Billings had an unusual appearance and a strong addiction to snuff. His contemporary wrote that Billings &quot;was a singular man, of moderate size, short of one leg, with one eye, without any address &amp; with an uncommon negligence of person. Still, he spake &amp; sung &amp; thought as a man above the common abilities.&quot; Billings died in poverty in Boston on September 26, 1800, leaving behind a widow and six children. His funeral was announced in the Columbian Centinel: &quot;Died- Mr. William Billings, the celebrated music composer. His funeral will be tomorrow at 4 o'clock, PM from the house of Mrs. Amos Penniman, in Chamber-street, West-Boston.&quot;\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nA bio's enclosed.
