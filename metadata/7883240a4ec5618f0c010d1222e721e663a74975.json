It was simply an EP containing the songs played by Barrett on the John Peel Show, recorded February 24 and transmitted March 14, 1970.\n\n01. Terrapin\n02. Gigolo Aunt\n03. Baby Lemonade\n04. Effervescing Elephant\n05. Two Of A Kind \n\n\nMagnesium Proverbs \n\nIt is a collection of lots of Syd stuff. Some of which is of good quality, some bad. There are a few common tracks which I believe are the standard released versions (Emily, Candy and a Currant Bun etc.) but some other rarer tracks of very good quality - Scream Thy Last Scream, Vegetable Man, Lucy Leave, King Bee. It also contains radio recordings of Reaction in G and Stoned Alone. These are not of such good quality. Also there is a few tracks of Syd supposedly during his only live solo performance (1st June 1970 I think) where he plays Baby Lemonade, Evervescing Elephant etc. but Im not sure about these. The quality is poor but it is definately Syd, and its definately live. The CD finnishes with a recording of the backwards message from the song Empty Spaces.\n\n\n\n       1. Lucy Leave\n       2.
