Considering their roots and constant evolution, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not surprising that Josh Reichmann and Sebastien Grainger found each other, but this incarnation seems to be perfect for a return to form for both.\n\nGarbage Night is a tangential mix of noise and pop that finds Josh and Sebastien running with whatever ideas come to mind. Considering the spontaneous nature in which the songs were written and recorded, the free feel of the songs isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overly surprising and ultimately the potential these 6-songs show is as exciting as the end result. \n\nThe patient deconstruction of the poppy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Consider Yourself CrazyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ into noise laden guitar is fantastic and flows perfectly into the pulsating/spazzy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Reincarnate YourselfÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but somehow doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel about of place compared to the synth sheen of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bankok NightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or the infectious Ã¢â‚¬Å“No SkinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Basically, Bad Tits has shown they can handle different tempos, energies and styles and the snippets of proggy punk and synth pop that weave in and out of each other are a tasty morsel of flavor that will satisfy us until the main course (a full length LP) arrives.
