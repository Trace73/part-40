It&amp;#039;s not 1995 anymore; we download torrents using broad band; we don&amp;#039;t download a single .rar every night from our IRC buddies with our 56k modems. WHY ARE PEOPLE STILLCDOING THIS? It just wastes everyone&amp;#039;s time, and the .rars are sometimes broken, and some people don&amp;#039;t have an endless amount of harddrive space... SO PLEASE STOP DOING THIS!\n\n\nMovie info:\n&quot;In a remote bar, costumers are advised by a newcomer to seal the place since hunger monsters will attack them in a couple of minutes.
