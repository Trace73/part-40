Many applications consider themselves to be so important that they trigger an auto-start command in the system without being requested. That means that every time the computer is booted up, they are started together with Windows, which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always the userÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intention. As a result of this, the start sequence becomes considerably longer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and manually shutting down most of the unwanted windows immediately afterwards because they simply arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t needed, certainly isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fun.\n\nThe Ashampoo StartUp Tuner 2 lists all auto-start entries and allows them to be individually deleted or to be deactivated. If the user proceeds with caution in this area, and at least deactivates all of the unnecessary entries, then they will be able to enjoy a clearly faster start to Windows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b38fa0e234a2c6095c2f477c14715f9b15fc6020","amp;dn":"Ashampoo+StarUp+Tuner+2+64-bit+%281-click+run%29%28registred%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b38fa0e234a2c6095c2f477c14715f9b15fc6020","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,143,160,226,52,162,198,9,92,47,71,124,20,113,95,155,21,252,96,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
