This is a 27 episode summary of a series that ran for nearly 30 years, condensed from the best episodes of the tapes he bought from the TV company after the series ended.\n\nThis is a re-encoded version of the series I previously uploaded which retains the video quality but reduces the file size and disk space required by 60%. The original rips were a ridiculous 490mb per file for episodes only 24 minutes in length because the ripper had used a bit rate of over 2500 when 1000 is more normal and ample for viewing quality. I've reduced it down to 190mb per episode. Also the original files had been encoded with different aspect ratios for some strange reason which I have also corrected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906c34db68785cae6e71e588a9f805532b020749","amp;dn":"Out+Of+Town+With+Jack+Hargreaves+-+190mb+Dvdrips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906c34db68785cae6e71e588a9f805532b020749","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,108,52,219,104,120,92,174,110,113,229,136,169,248,5,83,43,2,7,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
