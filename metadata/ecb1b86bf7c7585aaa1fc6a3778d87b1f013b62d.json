Morkoc (AP, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nPhysical sciences and engineering, as well as biological sciences have recently made great strides in their respective fields. More importantly, the cross-fertilization of ideas, paradigms and methodologies have led to the unprecedented technological developments in areas such as information processing, full colour semiconductor displays, compact biosensors and controlled drug discovery to name a few. \r\nTop experts in their respective fields have come together to discuss the latest developments and the future of micro-nano electronics. They investigate issues to be faced in ultimate limits such as single electron transitors; zero dimensional systems for unique properties; thresholdless lasers, electronics based on inexpensive and flexible plastic chips; cell manipulation; biosensors; DNA based computers; quantum computing; DNA sequencing chips; micro fluidics; nanomotors based on molecules; molecular electronics and recently emerging wide bandgap semiconductors for emitters, detectors and power amplifiers. \r\nContributions from top experts in this field\r\nCovers a wide range of topics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecb1b86bf7c7585aaa1fc6a3778d87b1f013b62d","amp;dn":"Advanced+Semiconductor+and+Organic+Nano-Techniques+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecb1b86bf7c7585aaa1fc6a3778d87b1f013b62d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,177,184,107,247,199,88,90,170,31,198,163,119,141,135,177,240,19,182,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
