It's one of the better films in the series but, as with all of the &quot;Road&quot; pictures, younger viewers won't get many of the topical gags or recognize some of the name actors in bit roles. Virtually all the &quot;Road&quot; pictures were sendups of various film genres, and this one takes on South Seas adventure-romances. Hope handles the jokes (and asides to the audience) whilst Bing croons a less-than-memorable collection of tunes by Burke and Van Husen. Lamour is gussied up in some colorful costumes in what was essentially her last &quot;Road&quot; movie.
