But while many people support transit in the abstract, it's often hard to channel that support into good transit investments.  Part of the problem is that transit debates attract many kinds of experts, who often talk past each other.  Ordinary people listen to a little of this and decide that transit is impossible to figure out.\n \nJarrett Walker believes that transit can be simple, if we focus first on the underlying geometry that all transit technologies share. In Human Transit, Walker supplies the basic tools, the critical questions, and the means to make smarter decisions about designing and implementing transit services.\n \nHuman Transit explains the fundamental geometry of transit that shapes successful systems; the process for fitting technology to a particular community; and the local choices that lead to transit-friendly development. Whether you are in the field or simply a concerned citizen, here is an accessible guide to achieving successful public transit that will enrich any community.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a076641784b900c0b0aa523ce871d23123848a","amp;dn":"Human+Transit+-+Jarrett+Walker.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a076641784b900c0b0aa523ce871d23123848a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,160,118,100,23,132,185,0,192,176,170,82,60,232,113,210,49,35,132,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
