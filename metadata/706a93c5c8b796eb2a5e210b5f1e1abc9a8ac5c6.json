Only one television series was made, and Hamilton felt mistreated by the BBC over the scheduling of the show. Hamilton went public with his displeasure over the show's scheduling and vowed never to work for BBC1 again. A radio version was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2004, with subsequent series in 2005 and 2007.\n\n The series is set in the world of TS Sports, a sports public relations firm, run by Trevor Heslop and his partner Sammy Dobbs. Trevor is portrayed as being an essentially decent honest man in a corrupt money-obsessed industry of sporting celebrity, who is still deeply in love with his estranged wife Meryl. Andy Hamilton also appears in a minor role within the show, and several actors who have worked in his other comedy shows for television and radio appear. Neil Pearson was in Hamilton's Drop the Dead Donkey.\n\n The other TS Sports office staff are the cool German receptionist Heidrun, whose lesbianism obsesses Sammy; the young black trainee Barry; and strongly Christian office manager Theresa.\n\n\n Cast:\n Neil Pearson - Trevor Heslop \n Paul Reynolds - Sammy Dobbs \n Rosalind Ayres - Theresa \n Michael Fenton Stevens - Ralph Renton \n Matthew Thomas - Toby \n Abdul Salis - Barry \n Cosima Shaw - Heidrun \n Joe Absolom - Scott \n\n\n Crew \n Andy Hamilton - Writer \n Andy Hamilton - Director \n\n\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E01 - Jason \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E02 - Ethics \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E03 - Samantha \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E04 - Antonia \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E05 - Divorce \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S01 - E06 - Quiz\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E01 - Work Experience\n\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E02 - Dog \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E03 - Stalker \n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E04 - Trust\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E05 - Marathon\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S02 - E06 - French\n\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E01 - Trial\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E02 - Beards\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E03 - Pre-nuptial\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E04 - Dead Cert\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E05 - Change\n Trevor's World Of Sport - S03 - E06 - Gap Year\n .\n\n Audio Format : MP3\n Duration : 28mn 1s\n Bit rate mode : Constant\n Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n Channel(s) : 2 channels\n Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n Resolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:706a93c5c8b796eb2a5e210b5f1e1abc9a8ac5c6","amp;dn":"Trevor%27s+World+Of+Sport+-+S01+to+03+-+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"706a93c5c8b796eb2a5e210b5f1e1abc9a8ac5c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,106,147,197,200,183,150,235,42,94,33,11,95,30,26,188,154,138,197,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
