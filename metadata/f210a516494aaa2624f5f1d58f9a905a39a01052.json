Hubbard\r\nPublished by CRC Press, Taylor &amp; Francis Group\r\n\r\nBooks in the Surfactant Science series emphasize surfaces and interfaces, including basic principles, major developments, and important applications. A substantial proportion of all physical phenomena involve interfaces in one way or another, and the practical and commercial applications of interface science are numerous. The series covers experimental phenomena, behavior and properties, major advances, experimental approaches, essential instrumental methods, theoretical strategies, and important applications. The level of presentation is intended for readers having a basic scientific training, such as advanced science students encountering the book topic for the first time, as well as scientific professionals refreshing their knowledge of engineering aspects of the topic and interface science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f210a516494aaa2624f5f1d58f9a905a39a01052","amp;dn":"Surfactant+Science+Series+%5BUpdated+at+2016.10.10%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f210a516494aaa2624f5f1d58f9a905a39a01052","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,16,165,22,73,74,170,38,36,245,241,213,143,154,144,90,57,160,16,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
