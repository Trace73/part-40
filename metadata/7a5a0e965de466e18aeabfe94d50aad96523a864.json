It was recorded live over several German and Japanese dates in late 1976 during the Rising world tour.\n\nThe deluxe edition was released on November 13th, 2012 in Europe. The second disc was originally planned to contain tracks from Osaka, Japan (December 9th, 1976). However, when the tapes from the archive were finally mixed and delivered for the project, the recordings were actually from the evening show in Tokyo, December 16th, 1976, minus &quot;Stargazer&quot; and &quot;Still I'm Sad&quot; as those particular reels could not be located. Therefore, &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot; is the same as the version on the first disc. The &quot;Blues&quot; section of &quot;Man on the Silver Mountain&quot; is also identical to that on the first disc.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 - Remastered \n\n1. \t&quot;Kill the King&quot; (Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio, Cozy Powell) \t5:32\n2. \t&quot;Man on the Silver Mountain/Blues/Starstruck&quot;   \t11:12\n3. \t&quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot;   \t15:35\n4. \t&quot;Mistreated&quot; (Blackmore, David Coverdale) \t13:03\n5. \t&quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot;   \t7:36\n6. \t&quot;Still I'm Sad&quot; (Paul Samwell-Smith, Jim McCarty) \t11:01\n\nDisc 2 - Bonus \n\n1. \t&quot;Kill the King&quot; (Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio, Cozy Powell) \t\n2. \t&quot;Mistreated&quot; (Blackmore, David Coverdale) \n3. \t&quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot;   \t\n4. \t&quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot; (Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio)\n5. \t&quot;Man on the Silver Mountain/Blues/Starstruck&quot; \n6. \t&quot;Do You Close Your Eyes&quot; (Blackmore, Ronnie James Dio)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a5a0e965de466e18aeabfe94d50aad96523a864","amp;dn":"Rainbow+-+On+Stage+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a5a0e965de466e18aeabfe94d50aad96523a864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,90,14,150,93,228,102,225,138,234,191,233,77,80,170,217,101,35,168,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
