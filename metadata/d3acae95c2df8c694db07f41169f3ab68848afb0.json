It was first released on 4 July 2005 on Necessary/Atlantic and Warner Music UK. It was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize, and reached #1 in the UK albums chart in January 2006, taking it about 5 months to reach #1 mainly due to the preceding single &quot;Cash Machine&quot; catching the sellers' attention; its original peak position was #6. It has reached sales of 1.2 million copies worldwide,[1] with over 300,000 in the UK alone. The single &quot;Gotta Reason&quot; is included on the soundtrack of the football video game FIFA 06. The cover of Stars of CCTV does not bear the &quot;Parental Advisory&quot; sticker, despite the profanity used in the single &quot;Living for the Weekend&quot;.\n\n&quot;Cash Machine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:42\n&quot;Middle Eastern Holiday&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:44\n&quot;Tied up too Tight&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:48\n&quot;Gotta Reason&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 2:49\n&quot;Hard to Beat&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:13\n&quot;Unnecessary Trouble&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:44\n&quot;Move On Now&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 5:08\n&quot;Better Do Better&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:37\n&quot;Feltham Is Singing Out&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 4:36\n&quot;Living for the Weekend&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:42\n&quot;Stars of CCTV&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€ 3:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3acae95c2df8c694db07f41169f3ab68848afb0","amp;dn":"Hard-Fi+-+Stars+of+CCTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3acae95c2df8c694db07f41169f3ab68848afb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,172,174,149,194,223,140,105,77,176,127,65,22,159,58,182,136,72,175,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
