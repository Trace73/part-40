Soon after, Langdon's brother Royston joined the band, and Spacehog was born. When the band's original guitarist left, Cragg called his friend Richard Steel to join. The band signed in 1994 with Seymour Stein to Sire Records.\n\nOn 24 October 1995, Spacehog released its first album, Resident Alien. It went gold on the Billboard charts, selling over 500,000 copies and spawned the hit single and video &quot;In the Meantime&quot; as well as the single &quot;Cruel To Be Kind&quot;. &quot;In the Meantime&quot; received heavy video and radio play, and was used as background music to BBC's Match of the Day football programme. The band performed the song on Channel 4's TFI Friday in 1996. The band's second album, The Chinese Album, was released on 10 March 1998. Though it did not sell as well as Resident Alien, the band's popularity continued to increase as Spacehog opened for more popular acts such as Pearl Jam and Supergrass. The Chinese Album had a more &quot;artsy&quot; sound, with the Pink Floyd-like piano on the opening track and Michael Stipe of R.E.M. contributing vocals to the song &quot;Almond Kisses&quot;.\n\nAfter the band was dropped by Elektra Records, Spacehog signed with the upstart label Artemis Records and released its third album, The Hogyssey, on 10 April 2001. The album continued the band's neo-glam approach and included the singles &quot;I Want to Live&quot; and &quot;At Least I Got Laid&quot;, as well as a funk version of Richard Strauss's &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;. The band joined The Black Crowes and Oasis on the Tour of Brotherly Love in support of the album, which proved to be the band's final major tour.\n\nRoyston Langdon and American actress Liv Tyler became engaged in February 2001, and married in Barbados on March 25, 2003. In December 2004, she gave birth to their son, Milo William Langdon. On May 8, 2008, the couple confirmed through representatives that they would be separating but remain friends.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f447e80943fc5d5d9f558fea820138b83c4d436","amp;dn":"Spacehog+-+Resident+Alien++320k++mp3++ak01010100+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f447e80943fc5d5d9f558fea820138b83c4d436","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,68,126,128,148,63,197,213,217,245,88,254,168,32,19,139,131,196,212,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
