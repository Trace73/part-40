The chapters ran in Young Magazine, a relatively small publication, and were then released in volume form, when it gained some cult following.\nWhat makes this manga particularly unique is not it`s characters, which represent fairly run-of-the-mill manga personalities like those found in FLCL, Azumanga, and even Sister Princess--which should give you a pretty good idea of what does make this manga interesting: the perfect blend of school humor, plain ridiculousness, and raging sexual innuendo.\nAh, fifth grade like you wish you remembered it! \n\n\n\nDescription taken from: http://anidb.info/a4241\n\nFor playback problems: http://cccp-project.net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:199069b299f2520b02cab177fbf1599cdac142c9","amp;dn":"%5BTriad%5D+Today+in+Class+5-2+%28DVD-ript%2C+complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"199069b299f2520b02cab177fbf1599cdac142c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,144,105,178,153,242,82,11,2,202,177,119,251,241,89,156,218,193,66,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
