Obama isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t being fair to the Republicans. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not rooting for Obamacare to failÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re out there working hard to make it fail. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not cheerleadersÃ¢â‚¬â€these guys are out on the field hitting people. Republicans say that the problems with Healthcare.gov show that Obamacare is unworkable. Right. If Amazon.com was having problems with its website, would that indicate that commerce itself was unworkable?\n\nBill Clinton is reminding people of how badly the Bush administration botched the rollout of Medicare Part D. People donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t remember that because there were so many, many other things that the Bush administration botched even worse. This Obamacare rollout is the worst thing that Republicans have been able to find to attack Obama with... and George BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comparable problems with Medicare Part D donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even make the list of BushÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst mistakes! \n\nFormer White House budget director Jeff Zients has been brought in as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fixerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for the website. Call me fussy, but shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t they have brought in somebody with more tekkie credentials? They shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been looking for the person to fix the website among former budget directorsÃ¢â‚¬â€they should have been looking for that person at Comic-Con.\n\nFox News is going off about all of the people who are losing their health coverage under Obamacare. Fox isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too concerned about why theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re losing that coverageÃ¢â‚¬â€because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re losing it because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being replaced with better (and often cheaper) coverage. If Obama was a fireman who pulled children out of a burning house, Fox News would report that he had forced a family out of their home.\n\nBrit Hume complained that people were being forced into coverage Ã¢â‚¬Å“for things they may feel they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The law requires that policies cover 10 essential benefits including mental health and maternity care. I can see why Fox News would be upset about coverage for mental health issuesÃ¢â‚¬â€the more people who have mental health care, the less likely theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be listening to Fox News.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b850db70394cdd948e9b560cf8c3d17e1f2ead42","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+28+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b850db70394cdd948e9b560cf8c3d17e1f2ead42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,80,219,112,57,76,221,148,142,155,86,12,248,195,209,126,31,46,173,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
