He had two love interests. The first was Gwenna who only made one appearance and was never seen again. The second was Tanee who would constantly play the role of damsel in distress, always being tied-up and needing to be rescued. His enemies included the Water Warriors and the Birdmen.\n\nJo-Jo was re-printed by several Golden Age publishers after Fox Features closed down including Star Comics who called him &quot;Bombo&quot;, Green who called him Congo King, and Ajax-Farrell Comics which renamed him &quot;Kaza.&quot; Fox Features also re-named Jo-Jo as Jungle Jo for a four issue series.\n\n\nSeed for all to enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bbc5665a759012dd29ead8ec3f96e1cf8630796","amp;dn":"Jo+Jo+The+Congo+King+1947+Fox+Features+Golden+Age","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bbc5665a759012dd29ead8ec3f96e1cf8630796","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,188,86,101,167,89,1,45,210,158,173,142,195,249,110,28,248,99,7,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
