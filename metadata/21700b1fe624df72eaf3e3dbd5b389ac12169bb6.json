On Children, this Baltimore-area group is equal parts Genesis and Fish-era Marillion, as singer Glenn McLaughlin once again leads the way in his best Phil Collins-meets-Fish vocal/lyrical synthesis... the compositions are so compelling, the melodies so engaging, and the performances so polished that it would be unfair to dismiss Children as another neo rip-off. These tracks flow incredibly well, thanks to the band members? selfless ensemble orientation. No pointless noodling here - any and all instrumental interludes complement the songs.\n\n\n01 Haze\n02 In Our Lives\n03 Given Away\n04 Late Of Conscience\n05 Cracker\n06 Eye Next To Glass\n07 Your Darkest Hour\n08 The Final Stroke\n\nRipped at 224kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21700b1fe624df72eaf3e3dbd5b389ac12169bb6","amp;dn":"Iluvatar+-+Children%28US+Neo-Progressive+rock+at+it%5C%27s+best%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21700b1fe624df72eaf3e3dbd5b389ac12169bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,112,11,31,230,36,223,114,234,243,227,219,213,179,137,172,18,22,155,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
