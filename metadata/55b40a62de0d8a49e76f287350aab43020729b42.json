He dosn't need effects, the man was brilliant.\n\nThe second set especially is sweet!\nTouch&gt;Throwing Stones&gt; Franklins. I think this is the only time they did that. Nice to hear that spacey early Throwing Stones space.\n\nEveryone is in good form. Up there as one of the better shows of 82' along with some other hot shows mainly August thru October.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b40a62de0d8a49e76f287350aab43020729b42","amp;dn":"Grateful+Dead+-+1982-12-30+-+Oakland+Auditorium+in+Oakland%2C+CA++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b40a62de0d8a49e76f287350aab43020729b42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,180,10,98,222,13,138,73,231,111,40,115,80,170,180,48,32,114,155,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
