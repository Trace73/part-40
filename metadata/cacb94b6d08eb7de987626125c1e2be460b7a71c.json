From remixed Rock to distorted Dance with Industrial elements in between.\r\nFeaturing the angst driven theatre rock of Marilyn Manson &amp; The Spooky Kids with The Untraceables remix of Strange Same Dogma, the programming and tape loops of Garbage with their previously unavailable on album Crystal Method mix of I Think Iâ€™m Crystalised, the Slipknot influenced and Roadrunner Recordsâ€™ priority act of 2003, Stone Sour, with their previously unavailable on album track Rules Of Evidence as well as Metal Punk pioneers Prodigy with their original mix of Voodoo People and the leading German Industrial act Front Line Assembly with their rare Kalte Farben remix of Life = Leben.\r\nThe Rock Matrix delivers over 2 hours of high octane music which will reawaken your senses. (Amazon)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important thing is to not be misled by the packaging of The Rock Matrix. \r\nThis is not a product affiliated with the science fiction movie starring the guy from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and that super-hot girl. This is actually music that could have been in that movie, had you muted the movie's sound and played this CD from start to finish. It's a two-disc compilation featuring a lot of electronica/industrial acts, and it's angry and intense, but nothing much of mind-blowing importance that would attract anyone but a die-hard industrial/electronica fan or those actually believing their name is Neo. \r\nCasual listeners are advised to follow the white rabbit elsewhere.
