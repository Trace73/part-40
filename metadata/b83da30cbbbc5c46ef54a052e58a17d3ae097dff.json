Brodie, the ECUP inhales deeply, lies back, and fills itself for hours, with 'Revenge of the Prowler'!\n\nPublished in 1988, Revenge of the Prowler was a follow-up to the four-issue mini from 1987, both written by Tim Truman and illustrated by John K. Snyder III. (The first four issue series can be purloined here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9152679/Eclipse_Fill_03_(Strike___Masked_Man__Prowler__Zooniverse))&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9152679/Eclipse_Fill_03_(Strike___Masked_Man__Prowler__Zooniverse))&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBig ups to the creators and scanners, as well as an especially loud HOO HA! to M.
