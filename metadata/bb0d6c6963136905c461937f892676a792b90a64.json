This was a non-downloadable track, so it was streamed at 128 kbps and that is evident in the quality. Still, the story behind the song and the talent of the composer made it worth getting, and this was the only source I could find. So be warned in advance, this is a departure from my standard of only ULing high-quality audio.  It's the best I could do in this case. What you have here is a 128 kbps quality song. All of that said, Enjoy!\n\nHere's the story behind the song:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.zefrank.com/theshow/whipass/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.zefrank.com/theshow/whipass/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThere are links above the text on that page to the audio files of the original submission by Ray and this remix.\n\nEnjoy and seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0d6c6963136905c461937f892676a792b90a64","amp;dn":"Whipass+-+Goose+Remix+%28Extended%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0d6c6963136905c461937f892676a792b90a64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,13,108,105,99,19,105,5,196,97,147,127,137,38,118,167,146,185,10,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
