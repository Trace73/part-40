Through the tradition of Glidewing racing, order is preserved amongst the remaining tribes with an annual Great Race, where the winner of five consecutive glidewing races selects a leader for the Great Tribal Council. The Pirate King has won four victories leaving him poised to undo the order the tribes of Neo Terra have worked to preserve. With the help of friends, an impulsive young glide wing pilot named Billy Boom Boom must stop the Pirate King before he unleashes dark forces that would change existence, as they know it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:936d512ad7bec4c06933b77e68c2f6be67b8355d","amp;dn":"Sky+Pirates+of+Neo+Terra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"936d512ad7bec4c06933b77e68c2f6be67b8355d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,109,81,42,215,190,196,192,105,51,183,126,104,194,246,190,103,184,53,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
