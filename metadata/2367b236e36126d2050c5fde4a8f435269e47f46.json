Like many others, Mary's father turned his flowerbeds over to growing veg for the war effort and ever since then, Mary has been hooked on growing her own fruit and vegetables.\n\nIn this programme, Mary travels to the Tangmere allotment in East Sussex, where she meets people from all walks of life growing their own, cooking and sharing recipes. The visit inspires Mary to cook some of her favourite dishes, including a recipe her own mother cherished - ginger orange poussin with freshly dug new potatoes.\n\nShe also makes a classic chutney to use up any leftover harvest veg, a dinner party treat of winter root vegetables using a new cut of lamb, the foreshank, and an absolute strawberry crowd-pleaser.\n\nWhilst down at the allotment, Mary helps to prepare a harvest feast to celebrate the end of the growing season","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2367b236e36126d2050c5fde4a8f435269e47f46","amp;dn":"Mary+Berrys+Absolute+Favourites-S01E05-WebDL-HD-x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2367b236e36126d2050c5fde4a8f435269e47f46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,103,178,54,227,97,38,210,5,12,95,222,74,143,67,82,105,228,127,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
