Whether the person is a harried colleague, a stressed-out client, or an insecure spouse, things will go from bad to worse if you can't break through emotional barricades.\n\nDrawing on his experience as a psychiatrist, business consultant, and coach, and backed by the latest scientific research, author Mark Goulston shares simple but powerful techniques readers can use to really get through to people--whether they're coworkers, friends, strangers, or enemies.\n\nGetting through is a fine art but a critical one. With the help of this groundbreaking book readers will be able to turn the &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;unreachable&quot; people in their lives into allies, devoted customers, loyal colleagues, and lifetime friends.\n\n----------------------\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e390f456dcbb876f167620275a69b32bd1e1eb1e","amp;dn":"Just+Listen+-+Mobi+ePub+pdf+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e390f456dcbb876f167620275a69b32bd1e1eb1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,144,244,86,220,187,135,111,22,118,32,39,90,105,179,43,209,225,235,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
