We'll take that rough geometry into Maya LT where we'll use polygon modeling tools to modify the basic structure. Back in ZBrush we'll use several techniques to sculpt stylized rocky detail into our model and add any necessary pieces. We'll continue the process by painting all of our objects. Finally we'll use ZBrush and Maya LT to create a cohesive UV layout and output normal and color maps for the objects. Then we'll bring everything together in Maya LT to preview it.\n\nOnce you've completed this volume, you can move on to Volume 6 where you'll go through the process of rigging and animating the hero character using Maya LT. Then you can continue on with volumes on rigging and animating the boss and final game assembly.\n\nThese tutorials are step-by-step using our particular concepts, but we really encourage you to have some fun and make it your own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1965893dab6e04ffab16c2cd0d0c773d2c451b7c","amp;dn":"Indie+Game+Dev+Pipeline+Vol+5%3A+Boss+Character+Modeling+and+Textu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1965893dab6e04ffab16c2cd0d0c773d2c451b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,101,137,61,171,110,4,255,171,22,194,205,13,12,119,61,44,69,27,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
