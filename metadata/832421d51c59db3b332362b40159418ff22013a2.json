It's pleasantness is mainly due to the agreeable voice of the vocalists and the beautiful melodies on some of the tracks. There are no technical pyrotechnics, but instead a clever use of acoustic instruments provides a very listenable texture. Standing out is Acimo And Noiram with a lovely melodic line along with Many Tribesmen. The opening track Home For Frozen Roses wouldn't be out of place on a Paul Simon album! The other tracks are nice enough, but do not contain much substance. Worth a spin, but do not pay the astronomical prices asked nowadays. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:832421d51c59db3b332362b40159418ff22013a2","amp;dn":"northwind+-+1971+-+sister%2C+brother%2C+lover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"832421d51c59db3b332362b40159418ff22013a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,36,33,213,28,89,219,59,51,35,98,180,1,89,65,143,242,32,19,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
