Album 'Kerai' (Spell), recorded the same year and released by Dangus in MC format, became a pleasant surprise and fresh wind in the modest scene of Lithuanian weird music. In 1997 a cassette '8 Nerimo VeidrodÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾iai' (8 Mirrors of Anxiety) was released by the author himself, it lacked proper sound quality, therefore was distributed only in the circle of friends (currently this work with improved sound is being distributed in CDr format). The next year MC 'Juodi Vasaros Trimitai' (Black Trumpets of Summer) was released, then ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ MC 'Breksta' (Breaking Dawn) followed in 2000. The first G.G. work in CD format delighted the audience in 2001 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ album 'S:S:S:S' was released by Dangus. 2003 'Procesai' the most uncompromising album was released. During the latter seven years Girnu Giesmes played live on several notable festivals of darkwave arts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Menuo Juodaragis, Kunigunda Lunaria, Sumirimas, Nordic Audio Modern fest., Wroclaw Industrial Festival [Pl], clubs in Latvia, supported Legendary Pink Dots in Vilnius, and etc. \n\n\nGirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s (Songs of the Millstones) is a perfect name for a post-industrial experimental act that sounds fairly cold and harsh, yet hints at archaic roots. The characteristic sound of GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s, the project of Laurynas Jukonis, indeed resembles that of a millstone in a way; the textural formations are repetitive, coarse and shadowy, but the source is organic and primeval. Having entered the Lithuanian dark electronic music scene back in 1995, GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s was very fertile in the subsequent years and managed to create a musical cosmology of its own kind. The latter borrows its primary language from dark industrial music, but is full of archaic symbols, rusted primitive soundscapes and psychedelic tonalities. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what makes the music of GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s affect the listener almost on the subconscious level ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where the blurred memories of the prehistoric past are buried. \n\nText: by Jurij Dobriakov\n___\n\nABOUT THE ALBUM\n\n&quot;Sau KraÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡tas&quot; ('Oneself Land') - cold and ascetic world, where the ships, which formerly drifted the thoughts through mountains of waves into archipelago of dreams, now is standing in the dunes of desert - deeply stucked in the sand. Its not the first morning the ships meets the dawn like that.\n&quot;Sau KraÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡tas&quot; is the latest album of the project GirnÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â³ GiesmÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€s ('Songs of the Millstones'). There are 5 compositions of 2008-2009 in this professionaly self releaced CD. The picture by technique of &quot;camera obscura&quot; were chosen for artwork. Such photographies reject everything what are unimportant - all distracting details are eliminated and only steady nuggets are left. The same matter suits the sound of &quot;Sau KraÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡tas&quot;. Comming deeper and deeper into yourself, climbing the stairs of existence until reaching the space for nobody else, but you. The space, where burnt-out pharos is not any more waiting for the ships arriving.\n\nText: by Eteris\n\nTrcklist:\n\n1.2 Brandinta Kupole (Nurtured KupolÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬â€*)\n3.
