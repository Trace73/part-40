The \nweapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they \nhave divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every \npretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive \nevery thought to make it obedient to Christ.\n\nBy using our spiritual authority we can demolish SatanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inserted thoughts and \nplace our minds in obedience to Christ. This is the victory that Jesus has already \nwon for you.\n\nRemember, God wants you to be Emotionally Free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb2c66222e6c71a139a6727cb72e1144c141e7df","amp;dn":"Being+Effective+in+Spiritual+Warfare","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb2c66222e6c71a139a6727cb72e1144c141e7df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,44,102,34,46,108,113,161,57,166,114,124,183,46,17,68,193,65,231,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
