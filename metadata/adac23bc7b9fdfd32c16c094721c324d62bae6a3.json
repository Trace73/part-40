Investigating some nearby warehouses, the travellers stumble into a trap that the Daleks have set for them. \n\nThe Daleks also attack a space station orbiting Earth in the future. Their aim is to rescue their creator, Davros, who has been held there in suspended animation since his capture by humanity. They want him to help them find an antidote to an anti-Dalek virus created by the Movellans. \n\nIn addition, the Daleks have constructed android duplicates and installed some of them in key positions of authority on Earth. They now intend to send duplicates of the Doctor and his companions to Gallifrey in order to assassinate the High Council of the Time Lords. \n\nThese plans ultimately fail, however, as one of their duplicate humans, Stien, rebels and destroys the space station. Davros is unable to find a cure for the virus but has an escape pod ready in case of problems. \n\nCommander Lytton, an alien mercenary working for the Daleks, escapes to Earth. Tegan, sickened by all the killing she has seen, decides to remain on her home planet.\n\nCast\n\nThe Doctor - Peter Davison\n\nTegan - Janet Fielding\n\nTurlough - Mark Strickson\n\nColonel Archer - Del Henney\n\nCrewmember - John Adam Baker\n\nCrewmember - Linsey Turner\n\nDalek Operator - John Scott Martin\n\nDalek Operator - Cy Town\n\nDalek Operator - Tony Starr\n\nDalek Operator - Toby Byrne\n\nDalek Voice - Brian Miller\n\nDalek Voice - Royce Mills\n\nDavros - Terry Molloy\n\nGalloway - William Sleigh\n\nKiston - Les Grantham\n\nLytton - Maurice Colbourne\n\nMercer - Jim Findley\n\nOsborn - Sneh Gupta\n\nProfessor Laird - Chloe Ashcroft\n\nSergeant Calder - Philip McGough\n\nStien - Rodney Bewes\n\nStyles - Rula Lenska\n\nTrooper - Roger Davenport\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adac23bc7b9fdfd32c16c094721c324d62bae6a3","amp;dn":"dr+who+resurrection+of+the+daleks+dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adac23bc7b9fdfd32c16c094721c324d62bae6a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,172,35,188,123,159,223,211,44,22,192,148,114,28,50,77,98,186,230,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
