It consists of wartime footage, movie newsreels, and propaganda films made from World War I through the Vietnam Conflict. No subtitles are available. Furthermore, the majority of the DVDs were produced so that it was not possible to fully separate the films with normal ripping software. Therefore, many of the disks had to be ripped as one long AVI file; some containing multiple films. I have ripped every disk to the highest resolution possible, with an average bit pixel ratio of 1.50. I would have liked to have released it all as one huge torrent (I still might if the demand is high enough), but after all this work, I really do not want this to die an unseeded death, so I have decided to release it in 6 batches to keep the size down. The DVDs contained no special features of any kind. Several of these films were either nominated or even won Academy Awards back in the day, and are not commercially available in any other venue I am aware of. For each torrent, I will include the screenshots and technical stats for one representative film.\n\nRambam 1776\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/National-Archives-Century-War-None/dp/B002MD3UL4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/National-Archives-Century-War-None/dp/B002MD3UL4&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaiLMaADJ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaiLMaADJ&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDVD 13\nA Nation Builds under Fire (1966) The social revolution of South Vietnam, narrated by John Wayne.\nTo Save a Soldier (1966) Henry Fonda narrates this documentary about what it takes to rescue a wounded soldier.\nReport on Marine Activities (1966) Footage of the USMC in action, featured recovery efforts and combat.\nAnother Day of War (1967) extraordinary film of the U.S. Air Force, including air and ground warfare, and rescues.\n\nDVD 14\nRiver Patrol (1967) A Navy Mobile Riverine Force patrols the Mekong Delta and battles with the Vietcong.\nVietnam Crucible (1968) War behind the scenes and out on the front lines, from training to operations and action.\nUSAF Combat Photography - Southeast Asia (1968) The 600 Photo Squadron jumps in the combat zones, risking their lives to film the war.\nWhere the Girls Are (1969) An airman suffers when he does not heed the precautions of the Department of Defense (uploaders note- this training film is hysterically funny!)\n\nDVD 15\nThe Battle of Khe Sanh (1969) A film recounting Khe Sanh, often considered the most important battle of the war.\nThe 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (1969) Watch the Blackhorse squadron move their massive vehicles from the road into the trees.\nThe 4th Infantry Division (1969) The most technologically advanced combat division in the battle of Dak and more.\nThe Faces of Rescue (1971) A pilot recounts his experience of being rescued by the Jolly Green Giant helicopter.\n\nDVD 16\nThe 1st Infantry Division in Vietnam (1971) The Big Red One participating in ambushes, The Tet Offensive, and Dong Tien.\nThe Drill Sergeant (1971) A drill sergeant instructs, shapes and molds new recruits and draftees into soldiers.\nVietnam, Vietnam (1971) A controversial documentary on the history of Vietnam, narrated by Charlton Heston.\nHistory of the Air Force - Vietnam and After (1977) The culmination of a controversial war.
