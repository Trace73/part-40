(Imperial College Press, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 9781783263271\r\n\r\nThe aim and purpose of the book is to provide an understanding of the current science underpinning Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) and to provide students and interested researchers with sufficient background on the basics of Chemical Engineering, Material Science, and Geology that they can understand the current state of the art of the research in the field of CCS. In addition, the book provides a comprehensive discussion of the impact on CCS on the energy landscape, society, and climate as these topics govern the success of the science being done in this field.\r\nThe book is aimed at undergraduate students, graduate students, scientists, and professionals who would like to gain a broad multidisciplinary view of the research that is being carried out to solve one of biggest challenges of our generation.\r\n\r\nReadership: Students taking courses on environmental sciences and research level individuals who are interested in environmental issues related to CCS.\r\n\r\nReadership: Students taking courses on environmental sciences and research level individuals who are interested in environmental issues related to CCS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f39fa9a829120fe04d7ff316179b9daa10675b8","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Carbon+Capture+and+Sequestration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f39fa9a829120fe04d7ff316179b9daa10675b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,57,250,154,130,145,32,254,4,215,255,49,97,121,185,218,161,6,117,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
