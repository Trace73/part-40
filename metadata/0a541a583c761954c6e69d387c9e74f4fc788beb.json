This is the ALMOST complete Swamp Loggers series. It is missing a total of 4 episodes that I have been unable to find over the last 2+ years. This is still the most complete torrent I have seen thus far for this show.\n\n\nSwamp Loggers is an American reality television series on the Discovery Channel that follows the crew of Goodson's All Terrain Logging as they log the swamps of North Carolina (mostly in Pender County where much of the series is filmed). It began as four pilot episodes which aired in June and July of 2009 and bloomed into a four season show. The concluding episode aired January 10, 2012.\n\n\nIf anybody finds the missing episodes (S01E01, S01E02, S04E05, S04E13) PLEASE share it with the rest of us by leaving a comment!!!\n\nEnjoy the show and happy torrenting!
