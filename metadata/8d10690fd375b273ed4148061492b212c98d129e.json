It seems to scarcely exist anymore even on the internet so here it is in all it\\&amp;#039;s glory. The company that made it seems to have vanished off the face of the planet.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription\n-------------------------------------------\nA face paced tank shooter based in the year 2030.\n\nOver 20 missions to play with comic style animated movies detailing the story line.\nMore then 10 weapons to choose from\n\nStory\n---------------------------------------\nAn extremely talented and ambitious physicist named Stephen Novotny, who previously worked for a top secret state program, now dreams of world supremacy. He launches a project of his own in the field of spatiotemporal transformations, based on the unofficial results of stolen governmental investigations. The climax of his project will be the creation of a miraculous Time Machine which will bring him absolute power.\n\nThe Machine is almost complete; it is already able to create chaotic shifts in time and space. Yet, to become fully functional it needs upgrades and adjustments. Stephen\\&amp;#039;s budget has run dry, and he realizes that he cannot continue to work on the project alone. So, he decides to find a partner. He recalls T.J., his one-time pal with a rather dark past.\n\n\nAt the moment T.J. is serving a life sentence in prison for terrorist action. The scientist understands that a villain like this perfectly fits into his plans. Novotny uses a super-tank - one of his hi-tech creations - to rescue T.J. from prison. In return T.J. must become Novotny\\&amp;#039;s right hand man and do all dirty work needed to upgrade the Machine to the best of its capabilities. In addition, T.J.\\&amp;#039;s role is to terrify the world, bringing destruction to the most important life centres.\n\n\nMinimum Requirements:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Pentium-II 233 MHz\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 32 Mb RAM\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 230 Mb free Hard Disk space\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 8x CD-ROM\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 3D Video Accelerator board (Glide / Direct 3D)\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ MS Windows compatible sound board\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Speakers\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 2-button Mouse\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ MS Windows 95 / 98 / 2000 / NT\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ DirectX 6.0 or higher\n\nRecommended\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Pentium-II 300 MHz\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 64 Mb RAM\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 32xCD-ROM\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ 3D Video Accelerator board of 2nd generation (such as Voodoo 2, Riva TNT 2, etc.)\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ MS Windows compatible Joystick","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d10690fd375b273ed4148061492b212c98d129e","amp;dn":"Killer+Tank+-+Full+PC+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d10690fd375b273ed4148061492b212c98d129e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,16,105,15,211,117,178,115,237,65,72,6,20,146,178,18,201,141,18,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
