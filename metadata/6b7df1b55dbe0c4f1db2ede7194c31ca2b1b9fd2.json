(2014)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\n\nElvis Presley may be the single most important figure in American 20th century popular music. Not necessarily the best, and certainly not the most consistent. But no one could argue with the fact that he was the musician most responsible for popularizing rock &amp; roll on an international level. Viewed in cold sales figures, his impact was phenomenal. Dozens upon dozens of international smashes from the mid-'50s to the mid-'70s, as well as the steady sales of his catalog and reissues since his death in 1977, may make him the single highest-selling performer in history. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD {RCA Victor/Sony Legacy 88843057612}\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Cue, Log, Audiochecker\n\n\n01.Promised Land\n02.What'd I Say\n03.Early Mornin' Rain\n04.You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' (Live)\n05.My Babe (Live)\n06.Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\n07.Got My Mojo Working  Keep Your Hands Off Of It\n08.Bridge Over Troubled Water\n09.Help Me Make It Through The Night\n10.Gentle On My Mind\n11.Funny How Time Slips Away\n12.Sweet Caroline\n13.You Don't Have To Say You Love Me\n14.Proud Mary\n15.I Got A Woman\n16.Words\n17.Something\n18.You Don't Know Me\n19.I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\n20.Danny Boy\n21.My Way\n22.Tomorrow Is A Long Time\n23.Only The Strong Survive\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b7df1b55dbe0c4f1db2ede7194c31ca2b1b9fd2","amp;dn":"Elvis+Presley+-+Elvis+Sings...+%282014%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b7df1b55dbe0c4f1db2ede7194c31ca2b1b9fd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,125,241,181,93,190,12,79,29,178,237,231,25,76,49,202,43,27,159,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
