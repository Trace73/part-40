It really is that time again.\nI&amp;#039;m just going to sit back and enjoy this... it seems like such a long time since the last show.\n\nGreat choice of theme for the first show coming back ... Money.\nI would expect the old Pink Floyd track to be in it but I suppose that&amp;#039;s just too predictable eh...? Mind you it seems this is just &amp;#039;Money Part 1&amp;#039; so that could mean that next week or some other future show we will get another show based on the theme of Money. I bet he&amp;#039;ll include the Floyd track on that one. :)\nTalking of money... I wonder what bank Bob uses.\n\nTRACKLIST\n01 That&amp;#039;s What They Want - Jerry McCain &amp; His Upstarts\n02 Pennies From Heaven - Louis Prima\n03 You Put It In, I Take It Out - Papa Charlie Jackson\n04 Blue Money - Van Morrison\n05 Greenbacks - Ray Charles\n06 Money - Mel Blanc\n07 It&amp;#039;s The Gold - Buddy &amp; Ella Johnson\n08 Farewell To The Gold - Nic Jones\n09 My Baby&amp;#039;s Just Like Money - Lefty Frizzell\n10 100 Dollar Bill - Buddy Guy\n11 It&amp;#039;s All About The Benjamins - Diddy\n12 Your Cash Ain&amp;#039;t Nothin&amp;#039; But Trash - The Clovers\n13 You Can&amp;#039;t Take It With You - Jesse Price\n\nDetails..\n  Format            :   LAME 3.98\n  Bitrate           :   VBR ~258K/s\n  Hz                :   44100Hz\n  Channels          :   Stereo\n  ID3 Tag           :   ID3v2.3\n  Duration          :   60:06\n\n  Total Size        : 111.0 MB\n\nEnjoy folks.
