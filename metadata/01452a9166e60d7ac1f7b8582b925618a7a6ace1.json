Even with all this work, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very difficult to get windows exactly where you want them, so most of the time windows are left scattered all over the screen. The solution? Divvy.\n\nDivvy is an entirely new way of managing your workspace. It allows you to quickly and efficiently Ã¢â‚¬Å“divvy upÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ your screen into exact portions.\n\nWith Divvy, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as simple as a single click and drag in the Divvy interface and your window will be resized and moved to a relative portion of the screen. If that seems like too much work, you can go ahead and create as many different shortcuts as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like that resize and move your windows.\n\nDivvy is designed to be quick, simple and elegant. We want it to stay out of your way as much as possible while providing the most powerful window management available today. Take a look at the screencast over there to the right to get a better idea of what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re talking about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n= How-To =\n* Patch the application by pressing the &quot;Patch&quot; button.\n* After patching, restart the application before you generate the keyfile or use the serial.\n* Use our keyfilemaker/keymaker to generate license file/license keys for the registration. (If it fails to validate, either this build of the application is not working with the patcher or you did not restart the application after you patch it)\n* Enter the generated serial or install the generated license file on your desktop.\n* Restart the app and enjoy.\n\n= NOTE =\n* The license files/license keys made by the keyfilemaker/keymaker will not work without patching the application first.\n* Restarting the application is needed for the patching to take effect.\n* Always block the application from phoning home with firewall or Little Snitch if possible.\n\nFYI, the patch we use is not some kind of offset patcher since the beginning.\nThey work cross versions on most of the cases for every mac release that needs to patch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01452a9166e60d7ac1f7b8582b925618a7a6ace1","amp;dn":"Mizage+Divvy+v1.3.4+MacOSX+Incl.+Keymaker+And+Patch-CORE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01452a9166e60d7ac1f7b8582b925618a7a6ace1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,69,42,145,102,230,13,122,193,247,184,88,43,146,86,24,167,166,172,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
