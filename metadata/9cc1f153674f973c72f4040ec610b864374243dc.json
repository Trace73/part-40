The Beltsville Crucible\n\n&quot;Thrice mixes the &quot;emo&quot; punk style with hardcore screaming and metal. Dustin Kensrue, the singer, can go from singing in a melodic voice to an intense scream, and can do it well. The guitarists are pretty good. They don't just play 3 chords; there are guitar harmonies and solos reminiscent of Iron Maiden. The drummer is insanely good. He's fast, but his fills are thought out and perfectly executed. Yes, this is a very talented band.\n\nThe songs rarely exceed 3 minutes. I usually listen to metal or progressive rock, so I'm generally used to longer songs, but Thrice can do so much so well in 3 minutes that the songs are just as strong as many of the longer ones I like. The music can go from melodic/emo to hardcore punk, with heavy riffing like Metallica and guitar harmonies like Iron Maiden. These guys are pretty diverse.\n\nThe lyrics blew me away. Rarely are bands this intelligent. I guess I shouldn't really go into the lyrics, but I'll just say they are very memorable and they'll make you think. I don't want to go on for too long here so I'll just say if you happen to be reading this review, try this. There's a good chance you'll like it.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc1f153674f973c72f4040ec610b864374243dc","amp;dn":"Thrice+Illusion+of+Safety","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc1f153674f973c72f4040ec610b864374243dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,193,241,83,103,79,151,60,114,244,4,14,198,16,184,100,55,66,67,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
