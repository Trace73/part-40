The two have made a number of strong LPs and CDs together (and individually as well), although it is tough to lavish sufficient praise on this duo-guitar date, played primarily on seven-string electric guitars. Each man adapts equally well, whether in the lead, providing rhythmic support for the other, or matching his partner's lyricism while playing the head of a song. An invigorating &quot;Three Little Words&quot; introduces the two masterful guitarists with a flourish, followed by a lightly swinging take of &quot;Jersey Bounce,&quot; the bluesy &quot;Two Funky People,&quot; and the strutting acoustic duet &quot;Test Pilot.&quot; Bucky is featured on two unaccompanied miniatures, &quot;My Romance&quot; and the rarely heard &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls.&quot; Very highly recommended.
