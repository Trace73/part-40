The sound was more &quot;rockish&quot; than her prior releases, and it was composed of work by mostly Generation X songwriters, including Natalie Merchant, Ryan Adams and Steve Earle. The title was taken from a line in Greg Brown's song &quot;Rexroth's Daughter&quot;. Critics and listeners were surprised that Baez's voice had lost little of its original power and beauty, given that she was sixty-two when she made the album.\n\nThe album was recorded at Allaire Studios, Shokan, New York, January - April 2003.\n\nAlbum was produced by Mark Spector. Backing musicians included: George Javori and Duke McVinnie.\n\nBaez dedicated the album to Michael Moore.\n\n Track listing\n&quot;Sleeper&quot; (Greg Brown) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 \n&quot;In My Time of Need&quot; (Ryan Adams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \n&quot;Rosemary Moore&quot; (Caitlin Cary) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15 \n&quot;Caleb Meyer&quot; (Gillian Welch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31 \n&quot;Motherland&quot; (Natalie Merchant) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44 \n&quot;Wings&quot; (Josh Ritter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01 \n&quot;Rexroth's Daughter&quot; (Greg Brown) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:19 \n&quot;Elvis Presley Blues&quot; (Welch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40 \n&quot;King's Highway&quot; (Joe Henry) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28 \n&quot;Christmas in Washington&quot; (Steve Earle) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:13 \n\n Personnel\nRani Arbo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Background Vocals \nGreg Calbi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Mastering \nSteve Chadie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Assistant Engineer \nMatthew Cullen ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Assistant Engineer \nGail Ann Dorsey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Background Vocals \nJames Harley ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Assistant Engineer \nByron Isaacs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Electric &amp; Acoustic Bass \nGeorge Javori ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums \nBrandon Mason ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Engineer, Mixing \nDuke McVinnie ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar, Bass \nNorman Moore ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Art Direction, Design, Photography \nDoug Pettibone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Acoustic Guitar \nBo Ramsey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer \nMark Spector ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Producer \nGreg Tobler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Assistant Engineer \nTom Tucker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Engineer \nDana Tynan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Photography \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf90d65f8905c0061e25fff4f2dff962787c6de","amp;dn":"Joan+Baez...Dark+Chords+on+a+Big+Guitar%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf90d65f8905c0061e25fff4f2dff962787c6de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,249,13,101,248,144,92,0,97,226,95,255,79,45,255,150,39,135,198,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
