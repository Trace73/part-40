Superbly crafted, with a perfect balance of quality musicianship, vocal talent, and modern programming. It just signals sheer class from the first listening, and does not wear thin over repeated plays.\n\nIf you like nujazz, then treat yourself to this. It has a smokey, oily and slightly disheveled flavour to it, mixed with a very contemporary vibe. Coming from the Sonar Kollectiv stable, you know its going to be good, but this has got to be one of their real jewels.\n\n\nMicatone are:\n\nLisa Bassenge - vocal:\n\nLisa Bassenge is 30 years old; she has her own jazz trio where you can also hear Paul Kleber on upright bass. In 2004 they recorded their third critically acclaimed album \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;three\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. Lisa Bassenge is also singing with the german band \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;nylon\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;.\nPaul Kleber - bass, percussion:\n\nPaul Kleber studied classical and jazz doublebass but he likes playing jazz much more. Besides the Lisa Bassenge Trio he also recorded two CDs with Nylon and two with Jazz Indeed. During Micatone shows you can see him also playing triangle and drums on a second drumset together with Tim.\nBoris Meinhold - guitar, electronics:\n\nBoris Meinhold worked as a studio and session guitar player until he noticed that the music he liked listening to almost never contained guitars. As a consequence he started working with samplers and computers and founded Micatone in 1999.
