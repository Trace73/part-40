The mystery of its origin was never solved. But now, after two hundred years of speculation, the dying planet Earth must prepare for the truth.\n\nDeepsix: In the year 2204, tragedy and terror forced a scientific team to prematurely evacuate Maleiva III. Nineteen years later, a rogue moon hurtling through space is about to obliterate the last opportunity to study this rare, life-supporting planet. With less than three weeks left before the disaster, superluminal pilot Priscilla &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchins -- the only even remotely qualified professional within lightyears of the ill-fated planet -- must lead a small scientific team to the surface to glean whatever they can about its lifeforms and lost civilizations before time runs out. But catastrophe awaits when they are stranded on this strange and complex world of puzzles and impossibilities. And now Hutch and her people must somehow survive on a hostile world going rapidly mad -- as the clock ticks toward apocalypse for a doomed enigma now called...\n\nChindi: The universe has been explored--and humanity has all but given up on finding other intelligent life. Then an alien satellite orbiting a distant star sends out an unreadable signal. Is it the final programmed gasp of an ancient, long-dead race? Or the first greeting of an undiscovered life form?\n\nOmega: A civilization-destroying omega cloud has switched direction, heading straight for a previously unexplored planetary system--and its alien society. And suddenly, a handful of brave humans must try to save an entire world--without revealing their existence.\n\nOdyssey: To boost waning interest in interstellar travel, a mission is sent into deep space to learn the truth about &quot;moonriders,&quot; the strange lights supposedly being seen in nearby systems. But the team soon discovers that their odyssey is no mere public-relations ploy, for the moonriders are not a harmless phenomenon. They are very, very dangerous-in a way that no one could possibly have imagined.\n\nCauldron: The year is 2255. The academy that trained the starfarers is long gone and veteran star pilot Priscilla &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchins spends her retirement supporting fund-raising efforts for The Prometheus Foundation, a privately funded organization devoted to deep space exploration.\n\nBut when a young physicist unveils an efficient star drive capable of reaching the core of the galaxy, Hutch finds herself back in the deepest reaches of space, and on the verge of discovering the origins of the deadly Omega clouds that continue to haunt her.\n\nStarhawk : Priscilla Ã¢â‚¬Å“HutchÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Hutchins has finally realized her lifelong dream: SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completed a nerve-bending qualification flight for a pilotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s license.\n\nHer timing is far from optimal, however. Faster-than-light travel has only recently become a reality, and the World Space Authority is still learning how to manage long-range missions safely. To make matters worse, efforts to prepare two planets for colonization are killing off native life-forms, outraging people on Earth.\n\nSo thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a lot of demand for space pilots. Priscilla thinks her career may be over before it has begun. But her ambition wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be denied, and soon she is on the bridge of an interstellar ship, working for the corporation that is responsible for the terraforming.\n\nHer working conditions include bomb threats, sabotage, clashes with her employersÃ¢â‚¬â€and a mission to a world, adrift between the stars, that harbors a life-form unlike anything humanity has ever seen. Ultimately, she will be part of a life-and-death struggle that will test both her capabilities and her character...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eac0b9f9a7f304ebce34f07d0870009abf19adc3","amp;dn":"The+Academy+Series+-+Jack+McDevitt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eac0b9f9a7f304ebce34f07d0870009abf19adc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,192,185,249,167,243,4,235,206,52,240,125,8,112,0,154,191,25,173,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
