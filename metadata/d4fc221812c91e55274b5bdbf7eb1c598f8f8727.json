At this point, the band had collapsed into a trio, without a full-time drummer, but leader Bill Henderson and guitarist/keyboardist/drummer Brian MacLeod had become a powerful songwriting team during the interim. The album spawned a major hit single, &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone).&quot; that reached #1 in Canada and the Top 20 in the U.S. This was Chilliwack's first hit since the 1979 collapse of their former label Mushroom Records, and led to a touring version of the group re-forming. &quot;I Believe&quot; was also a Top 10 Canadian hit and Top 40 U.S. hit off the album.\n\nOverall the album is something of a concept album about the &quot;rock and roll&quot; lifestyle and the pursuit of fame. The leadoff track &quot;Sign Here&quot; is a reference to Chilliwack's new quest for mainstream success, tempered by their brush with fame on Mushroom. This was the first album they recorded with Solid Gold Records in Canada, a new Toronto-based label.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy EAC rip to FLAC. \nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4fc221812c91e55274b5bdbf7eb1c598f8f8727","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Wanna+Be+A+Star+%281981%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4fc221812c91e55274b5bdbf7eb1c598f8f8727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,252,34,24,18,201,30,85,39,75,91,219,247,235,28,89,143,143,135,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
