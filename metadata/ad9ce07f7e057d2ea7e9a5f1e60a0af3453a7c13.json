After a failed business deal he owes money to the much more successful gangster Dadan. Dadan has a sister, Afrodita, that he desperately wants to see get married so they strike a deal: Zare is to marry her. But none of the two care much for an arranged marriage: Zare is in love with Ida, Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. \n\n\nInbrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nd svensk text[Hardcore swesub]\n\n\nEnjoy&amp;seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad9ce07f7e057d2ea7e9a5f1e60a0af3453a7c13","amp;dn":"Black+Cat+White+Cat%5B1998%5DDvDrip.Swesub.NeRoZ.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad9ce07f7e057d2ea7e9a5f1e60a0af3453a7c13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,156,224,127,126,5,125,46,167,233,165,241,230,10,10,243,69,58,124,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
