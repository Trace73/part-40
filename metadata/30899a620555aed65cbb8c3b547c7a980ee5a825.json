Johnson later turned to blues music and he soon had his own little blues trio together, later moving to Chicago, Illinois, in the early 1960s. He played with musician Elmore James and later was a regular fixture in the Muddy Waters band by the mid-1960s. In the 1960s he recorded the song, 'The Twirl,' for the Chess Records Label. In 1970 Johnson moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work as a solo artist. From 1970 to 1976 Johnson worked the college and blues festival circuit before he was taken ill. Johnson died on March 18, 1976, at the age of 41,in Boston, Massachusetts, following a battle with cancer.
