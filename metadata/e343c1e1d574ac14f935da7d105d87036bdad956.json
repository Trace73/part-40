Country Bumpkin (3:06)\n09. Just Keep Going (5:44)\n10. All For You (5:23)\n11. Bring Me Wine (7:36)\n\n\nBird's vocal style is probably comparable to Nelly Furtado and particularly K.T. Tunstall - She's able to use beautiful, quiet and tender notes, with higher snarl-like climaxes. Some of the songs on this album do sound slightly similar, but each is unique as well. 'Counting To Sleep' is a tense tale which builds up to a great climax. '6ft8' is just great, its got a really original composition and some lovely vocals.\nThe heartfelt and poignant 'The Circle' is another of my favourites and definitely one of the highlights of the album - I really love the guitar and Bird's intimate vocals on this album, as well as the climax. 'Blossoms In The Street' is a startling, radio-friendly song, very good. The loveliest songs on the album are certainly 'You Are Mine' and 'All For You', two love songs which are both simple yet deeply heartfelt.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e343c1e1d574ac14f935da7d105d87036bdad956","amp;dn":"Wallis+Bird+-+Spoons+%5B2007%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e343c1e1d574ac14f935da7d105d87036bdad956","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,67,193,225,213,116,172,20,249,53,218,125,16,93,135,3,107,218,217,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
