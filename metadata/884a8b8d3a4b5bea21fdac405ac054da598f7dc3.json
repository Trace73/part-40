Grains and seeds possess potent health-giving properties; they are packed with vitamins, dietary fibre and essential amino acids, and are known to support the immune system. But most people donâ€™t incorporate enough of these superfoods into their diets, and they are missing out â€“ on both the health benefits and on the flavour! Amy Ruth Finegold has rid herself of the health problems that plagued her and discovered a whole new exciting way to eat by embracing these ancient grains â€“ from amaranth to bulgur, buckwheat to teff. Get off to a good start with Breakfast options including Amaranth Porridge and Pineapple Bran Muffins. Soups include the fruity and tangy Summer Melon Soup with Tamarind, while Salads &amp; Snacks also make a perfect light meal â€“ try a Wheatberry Salad with Apples and Pecans. Satisfying Main Dishes to enjoy include Millet-stuffed Acorn Squash and Lamb Chops with a Warm Quinoa Apricot Salad. Seeds and grains work well in Sweet Treats, too; try Peach Pie with a Sunflower Seed Crust or treat yourself to Peanut Butter Quinoa Cookies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:884a8b8d3a4b5bea21fdac405ac054da598f7dc3","amp;dn":"Super+Grains+and+Seeds+%282015%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"884a8b8d3a4b5bea21fdac405ac054da598f7dc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,74,139,141,58,75,91,234,33,253,172,64,90,192,84,218,89,143,125,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
