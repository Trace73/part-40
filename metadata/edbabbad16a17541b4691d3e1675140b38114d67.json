It begins with a discussion of the fundamental concepts underlying the medical use of imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine. Subsequent chapters are organized by anatomic region and imaging modality that highlight the radiologistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s role in diagnosing and treating common disorders. Each chapter offers learning objectives to aid readers in recognizing important points and connecting the basic radiology concepts.\n\nThe fifth edition is thoroughly updated and includes new or expanded chapters on nuclear medicine, pediatric radiology, and emerging imaging techniques. A comprehensive question bank, which functions as a valuable self-assessment tool, concludes the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edbabbad16a17541b4691d3e1675140b38114d67","amp;dn":"Radiology+Fundamentals%3A+Introduction+to+Imaging+and+Technology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edbabbad16a17541b4691d3e1675140b38114d67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,186,187,173,22,161,117,65,180,105,29,62,22,117,20,11,56,17,77,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
