This new title is a complete, two-volume set that examines special diets such as a Gluten-free or high protein diet, dieting and popular weight-loss programs such as the Atkins Diet, dietary concerns, nutritional basics, and some effects of a person's dietary choices on one's health.\n\n&quot;The Gale Encyclopedia of Diets outlines various weight loss and other medically-recommended programs in a balanced, well-researched way, making the set an ideal resource for patrons doing research before making lifestyle changes or for students comparing various popular diets for their health classes,&quot; said Kate Hanley, product manager at Gale.\n\nPresenting an overview of all topics, the Encyclopedia is not intended to be an endorsement of any one diet or lifestyle. The diets included are organized around the development and history of a diet, its basic principles, any key figures that influence the trend, and any public or regulatory concerns associated with the practice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b2f7086192a359a57edc3b242f4fe21448cf091","amp;dn":"The+Gale+Encyclopedia+of+Diets+-+A+Guide+to+Health+and+Nutrition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b2f7086192a359a57edc3b242f4fe21448cf091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,47,112,134,25,42,53,154,87,237,195,178,66,244,254,33,68,140,240,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
