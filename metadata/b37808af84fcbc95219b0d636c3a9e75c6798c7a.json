Thousands of people\nhave heard about them, scores have been affected by them, yet but a handful has ever heard or read them.\nHere they are.\nThere are other compelling reasons, the first having to do with the magnitude of their author. No other\nAmericanÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½and only a few individuals throughout the worldÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½has left such a strong mark on so many\naspects of the twentieth century: from poetry to economics, from theater to philosophy, from politics to\npedagogy, from ProvenÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§al to Chinese. If Pound was not always totally accepted, at least he was\nunavoidably there.\nThose traits of mind and character that made Pound so inescapable are not only evident in the\nbroadcasts but also present in ways that make them more fully understandable. Here is that same fearless\nplunge toward the heart of the matterÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½often heedless of consistenciesÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½that marked his study of ancient\nand exotic languages and cultures. Here is that same urge to simplify and instruct that marked his\nunorthodox textbooks: ABC of Economics, ABC of Reading and the rest. Here is that flair for dramatic\nhyperbole which peppered the Cantos and produced such deliberately shocking titles as Jefferson and/or\nMussolini. The broadcasts do not always show these traits at their best, but their blatant presence makes\nthem useful clues in putting together the puzzle of that powerful enigma at their center.\nEven if the shadow of Ezra Pound did not so broadly color this century, these broadcasts might still\ncommand a clinical respect for the way in which they interrelate so vitally with the rise of fascism in\nEurope and the accompanying extremes of feelings, with the cause and conduct of World War II as viewed\nfrom this special place by this very special commentator. To the historians who have counted this an almost\nanti-ideological war, the broad casts offer considerable counterpoint. Furthermore, they are the starting\npoint for understanding two major cultural events of the postwar years: the trial of Ezra Pound and the\nliterary prize controversies. The Bollingen Prize debateÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½by itself the politico-literary cause cÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©lÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨bre of the\ngenerationÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½while once totally preoccupying has to this day refused to lie at rest. Even this young\nGreenwood Press series, begun twenty-five years after the fact, offers two fresh and extensive treatments\nof the issue. Such insistent unrest shows clearly the need for this essential evidence now at hand.\nThe broadcasts do not show Pound at his best. War, bigotry, and totalitarianism are not sunny subjects.\nYet giant figures need their full dimensions, and unpleasant subjects can and should be studied for the best\nof reasons. How indeed are we to lessen our chances for future encounters with shrinking horizons if we do\nnot learn from episodes so recent, so strongly cast, and so richly charted?\nWe applaud, then, the respect for a complete historic record which has allowed the Pound Literary\nTrustees to overcome an understandable reluctance toward seeing these scripts in print. We applaud this\nsame impulse which has motivated the patience and stamina of Leonard Doob. There are, and there will\nalways be, more motives behind an act like this than one can chronicle. From our point of view, however,\nthis work provides a singular and extensive collection of data for the pursuit of that most bewildering of\ncultural equations: the balance between the creative force, the individual personality, and the social\ncontext.
