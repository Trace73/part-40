Le Guin set in her fictional universe of Hainish Cycle. The Telling is Le Guin's first follow-up novel set in the Hainish Cycle since her 1974 novel The Dispossessed. It tells the story of Sutty, a Terran sent to be an Ekumen observer, on the planet Aka, and her experiences political and religious conflicts between a corporatist government and the indigenous resistance, which is centered on the traditions of storytelling, locally referred to as &quot;the Telling&quot; (for which the book is named).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9913243d86f3f4bf432a14b57e20b3af60083266","amp;dn":"telling+-+ursula+k+le+guin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9913243d86f3f4bf432a14b57e20b3af60083266","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,19,36,61,134,243,244,191,67,42,20,181,126,32,179,175,96,8,50,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
