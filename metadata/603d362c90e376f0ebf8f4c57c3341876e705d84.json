But in the hands of an Artist like Jack Mooney, the instrument gives in return some of the world?s most beautiful music.\n\nJack Mooney?s artistry on the steel guitar goes back to his birthplace in Winnipeg, where he worked at local dances and radio shows.  Later he moved to Edmonton, met King Ganam, and worked with his popular ?Sons of the West? band.  Jack was later featured\nOn his own radio show at CJCA in Edmonton, then Jack moved to Montreal, where he played well known clubs for 5 years.  Arriving in Toronto,  Jack rejoined The King Ganam band and played steel guitar for 6 years on CBC-TV?s Country Hoedown.\n\nThe Rickenbacker Console Pedal Steel Guitar, shown on the album front, was specially built for jack by Rickenbacker of Santa Ana, California; and is a showpiece wherever Jack goes. \n\nRelax and Listen as Jack plays it in a sparkling grouping of old favorites.\n\nBarry Nesbitt  Asst.
