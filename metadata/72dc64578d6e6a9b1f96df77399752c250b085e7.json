This LP is a revelation, portraying a songwriter whose oeuvre is lodged somewhere between Townes Van Zandt and Leonard Cohen, with an extra dose of unearhliness thrown into the mix on the darkly reverberant 'Dear Father', 'Winter Woman' and the wonderful 'Jimmy's Got A Music Box'. Anyone interested in the history of alternative country should check in with this record, which arrives remastered and reissued for the first time since its initial very limited circulation. Highly recommended\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72dc64578d6e6a9b1f96df77399752c250b085e7","amp;dn":"Jay+Bolotin+-+Jay+Bolotin+%281970%2F2009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72dc64578d6e6a9b1f96df77399752c250b085e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,220,100,87,141,110,106,155,31,150,223,119,57,151,82,194,80,176,133,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
