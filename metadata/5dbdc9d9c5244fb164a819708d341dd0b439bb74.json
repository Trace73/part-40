No one is better qualified to talk about Springsteen than the man himself, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s often as articulate and provocative in interviews and speeches as he is emotive onstage and in recordings. While many rock artists seem to suffer through interviews, Springsteen has welcomed them as an opportunity to speak openly, thoughtfully, and in great detail about his music and life. This volume starts with his humble beginnings in 1973 as a struggling artist and follows him up to the present, as Springsteen has achieved almost unimaginable wealth and worldwide fame. Included are feature interviews with well-known media figures, including Charlie Rose, Ted Koppel, Brian Williams, Nick Hornby, and Ed Norton. Fans will also discover hidden gems from small and international outlets, in addition to radio and TV interviews that have not previously appeared in print. This collection is a must-have for any Springsteen fan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbdc9d9c5244fb164a819708d341dd0b439bb74","amp;dn":"Springsteen+on+Springsteen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbdc9d9c5244fb164a819708d341dd0b439bb74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,189,201,217,197,36,79,177,100,168,25,112,141,52,29,208,180,57,187,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
