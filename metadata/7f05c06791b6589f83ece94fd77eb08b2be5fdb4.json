Historical discussions of cities and towns in this book are organized, not chronologically, but arranged by genre, such as orthogonic, concentric and linear environments. This book chronicles urbanization from the ancient Greeks through the dreams of futuristic idealists in the 1960s. Moholy-Nagy's text is vivid and engaging, and the plans and photographs complement it nicely. Equal discussion is given to many major cities around the world, although the evolution of New York City seems to the focus in the latter part of the narrative. Overall, this book earns its place among the many works out there on urban history, and is a must for anyone interested.\n\n(Ben F, Amazon)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f05c06791b6589f83ece94fd77eb08b2be5fdb4","amp;dn":"Matrix+of+Man+-+an+Illustrated+History+of+Urban+Environment+%28Arc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f05c06791b6589f83ece94fd77eb08b2be5fdb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,5,192,103,145,182,88,159,131,236,233,79,215,126,176,139,43,229,253,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
