There are no Friday night movies, no school dances, and no stolen kisses between classes. It totally sucks! What makes it even worse, souls pop up when she least expects it. The last one is not her fault, but it all adds up to zero quality time with her super hot, scythe-carrying boyfriend, Echo.\n\nSince Cora was etched with special runes by an evil Immortal, she understands why souls are drawn to her. She makes the best of it by helping souls find closure while Echo escorts them to the realm of the dead. Perfect partners, until a dark soul visits Cora in the dead of the night and Echo decides her soul-helping days are over.\n\nCora can either listen to Echo or follow her instincts. To make matters worse, other reapers start stalking her, demanding she hand over the soul. Even her Valkyrie friends think sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone too far. But something sinister is coming their way, and the soul is the key to saving her town, her friends, and her relationship with Echo. Can she convince Echo to see things her way before itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too late?\n\nFormats: EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, PDF, LIT\nASIN#: B00N9KYZ18\nPublished: August 1st, 2014\nLanguage: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4399ed0109dddfde0a1d8caabf37999c3a0cd3","amp;dn":"Souls+%28Grimnirs+%232%29+-+Ednah+Walters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4399ed0109dddfde0a1d8caabf37999c3a0cd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,67,153,237,1,9,221,223,222,10,29,140,170,191,55,153,156,58,12,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
