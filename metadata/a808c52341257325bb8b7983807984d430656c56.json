When a group of climbers witness the murder of a young Tibetan nun who is fleeing to India, two men have a choice: turn a blind eye and preserve their climbing careers or alert the world to the grand scale of human injustice played out daily in Tibet. \n\nIntrepid journalist Jonathan Green here investigates the clash of cultures at the rooftop of the world. As he gains entrance to a fascinating network of Tibetan guides and safe-houses operating in the name of freedom, investigates the tradition of extreme mountaineering in Chinese-occupied Tibet, and establishes contact with surviving refugees, he offers a rare, affecting portrait of modern Tibet and raises enduring questions about morality and the lengths to which we go to achieve freedom.\n\nThis gripping news story illuminates the complicated politics of an exotic place, and is a fascinating read that introduces us to the extreme worlds of western adventurers and Eastern freedom seekers while offering entrance into the dramatic hardships of modern Tibet.\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; MP3CD Unabridged edition (June 1, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1441747834\nISBN-13: 978-1441747839\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
