Comics]\n\nIt is the far future; the human race has finally colonized the galaxy, preserving an era of prosperity thats only possible because of The Hypernaturals. Theyre a celebrated, galaxy wide superhero task force that keeps the peace. That is, until they all mysteriously vanish. Now, as the galaxy teeters on the brink of chaos, its up to a group of retired and long forgotten Hypernaturals -- and their novice recruits -- to save the galaxy from complete destruction. Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, the superstar writing duo behind ANNIHILATION and THE LEGION, launch an all new original series that takes cosmic super heroes to a new frontier.\n\n\n*** Enjoy and Please SEED ***\n\n\n\nThere are way too many great uploaders to list anymore :) Search TPB Comics and you'll find almost anything you want.
