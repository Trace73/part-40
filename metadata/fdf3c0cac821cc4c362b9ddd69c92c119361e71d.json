Do we expect him to move in miraculous ways in our day-in and day-out lives? Maybe we'd like to see miracles, but it's hard to see past our problems. All that is about to change, like water into wine.\n\n&quot;There are miracles all around us all the time,&quot; says Mark Batterson, &quot;but you won't see them if you don't know how to look for them.&quot;\n\nNow the bestselling author of &quot;The Circle Maker&quot; reveals the incredible power of the seven miraculous signs of Jesus found in the Gospel of John. Batterson shows how they were not simply something Jesus did in the past, but something he wants to do now, in the present. He shares true stories of people today who are experiencing miracles in their lives. And he brings to light countless miracles, big and small, that we take for granted every day that point us toward the One who healed the sick, calmed the storm, and yes, even raised the dead.\n\nBut this is more than a book about miracles. It's a book about the only One who can perform them. Batterson cautions readers, &quot;Don't just seek miracles. Seek Jesus. And if you seek Jesus, miracles will find you.&quot;\n\nNothing has changed since Jesus called Lazarus out of his tomb four days after his funeral. Our impossible situations still double as God's greatest opportunity to reveal his glory. No matter how big the problem is, God is bigger still. Anyone who longs to see God work in miraculous ways today will love Batterson's faith-building, life-giving message.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdf3c0cac821cc4c362b9ddd69c92c119361e71d","amp;dn":"The+Grave+Robber+%28Mark+Batterson%29+Retail+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdf3c0cac821cc4c362b9ddd69c92c119361e71d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,243,192,202,200,33,204,76,54,43,157,221,105,201,44,17,147,97,231,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
