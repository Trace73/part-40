As any devotee of What Wave is aware, in my dictionary the words God and Fleshtones are interchangeable, so any band with even the remotest link to the Fleshtones peaks my interest. \nSo, when I ran across the Love Delegation album 'Spread the Word' quite a number of years ago, featuring main men, Peter Zaremba and Keith Streng I just had to check more closely. Further study revealed names like Bill Milhizer (making 3 'tones in total), Barrence Whitfield (of Savages fame), Wendy Wild (Mad Violets), Kenny Margolis (Lucky 7), Dave Faulkner (Hoodoo Gurus), Pat Dinizio (Smithereens) and so forth. And the music, well just good 'ole happy rock and roll. \nDance music as it should be played - no pretension, just a great beat you can boogie to. &quot;I give it a 10, Dick.&quot; (virginmedia.com)\n\n\n\nThis is a slab of vinyl that I am DAMN glad to see dressed up for digital! Peter Zaremba enlisted delegates Wendy Wild, Barrence Whitfield and others to throw everything they had into this collection of 60's garage faves and note-perfect originals. \nI defy you not to be drenched in sweat after a single listen -- the horns, guitars, and sing along vocals have an infectious energy that is IMPOSSIBLE to fight.\nIf you're heart's in consternation, don't waste time -- Send in the LOVE DELEGATION!
