And one night we were in the pub...stayed after time...lock-in job.   You know the way that conversations, after too many beers, can verge off at strange tangents.   This Mike dude used to get up and play the drums.   He was real good.\n   Anyway...like I say about strange tangents - somehow got into an argument about the Boxer Rebellion.   And this dude is making me look a right cunt.   He really knew what he was going on about.   Dickhead me got tied up in knots.\n   A few days later, I find out that the dude lectured in history at some university in the south of England.   That was me shot down in flames...again!!!\n   Do not judge a book by its cover.
