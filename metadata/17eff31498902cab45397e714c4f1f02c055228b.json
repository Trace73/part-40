John Payne stars as &quot;town tamer&quot; Jefferson Harder, who intends to clean up the wide-open community of Laramie. Everyone knows that the outlaw gang headed by Jim Shanessy (Dan Duryea) is responsible for preventing the railroad from building a line into Laramie, but Shanessy always manages to intimidate the all-male juries into releasing him. He and saloon-hall gal Lou Carter (Mari Blanchard) want to keep the rails out of Laramie so that both can pursue their criminal activities unabated. But when Lou switches sides and aligns herself with Harder, it's the beginning of the end for the scurrilous Shanessy. The film's resolution is &quot;borrowed&quot; from the 1941 western The Lady From Cheyenne and works just as well here as it did in the earlier picture.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047389/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047389/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3581568/rails-into-laramie-pb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/subtitles/3581568/rails-into-laramie-pb&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 560x416\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 29,97\nBitRate : 1604 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17eff31498902cab45397e714c4f1f02c055228b","amp;dn":"Rails+Into+Laramie+%281954%29+VHSrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17eff31498902cab45397e714c4f1f02c055228b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,239,243,20,152,144,44,171,69,57,126,113,76,79,31,2,192,85,34,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
