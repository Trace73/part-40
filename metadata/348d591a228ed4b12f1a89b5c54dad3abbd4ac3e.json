The strength, sensitivity and excitement which characterize Candido's solos, indicate that his soul is equally divided between North and South American influences and reflects the best of both. \r\nWhether he is playing three conga drums simultaneously, as he does on â€œTonyâ€™s Theme,â€ â€œSoul Limbo,â€ â€œCome On Choo-Choo Trainâ€ and â€œJump Back,â€ or bongos and conga drums simultaneously, as he does on â€œThousand Finger Man,â€ he generates a special kind of rhythmic pulse that certainly should inspire new versions of current dances. When he plays only bongos as he does on â€œHallelujah!, I'm Cornin' Home,â€ the clarity and excitement that are present in his conga playing are also very evident.\r\nWhen Candido plays concerts at Lincoln Center or club engagements in Las Vegas, the audience reacts as much to the visual aspects of his playing as they do to the audible aspects. But on this record Candido proves once again that you only have to listen carefully to fully appreciate the unique excitement of the â€œThousand Finger Man.â€\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                            Billy Taylor (original liner notes)\r\n                                                                                                                            \r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/HFgl9XX.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
