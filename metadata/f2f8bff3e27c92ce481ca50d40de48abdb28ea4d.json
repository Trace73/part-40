Blending classic Disney storytelling characters and the mysterious underground world of bugs, Lasseter has created a film that can be enjoyed by all audiences, and another franchise in the process. A Bug's Life is a computerized retelling of the Aesop fable The Ant and the Grasshopper, made as a cartoon-short by the one-and-only, Walt Disney, in the mid-'30s. However, A Bug's Life has modernized the story with many new twists and celebrity voices. The story focuses on a colony of ants who seasonally gather food for themselves and a wild gang of rowdy grasshoppers. When bumbling worker ant Flik (David Foley) destroys the food supply, the angry grasshoppers, lead by the maniacally warped Hopper (Kevin Spacey), threaten to kill the ants if they don't produce a new supply of food by the time they return -- an impossible feat. Flik leaves the anthill in search of help in the form of bigger bugs, and to wage war against the grasshoppers. What he doesn't know is he has actually discovered a group of down-on-their-luck traveling circus insects in need of a job. When the ants realize that their heroes are really circus performers (and the circus bugs realize these grasshoppers are really big and mean), the situation goes from bad to worse. Ultimately, the ants use their large numbers to overcome the grasshoppers.\n\nRipped with Handbrake\n\nLength: 1 Hour 35 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4\n\nFrame Width: 1280\n\nFrame Height: 544\n\nFrame Rate: 29fps\n\nAudio\n\nBit Rate: 149kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f8bff3e27c92ce481ca50d40de48abdb28ea4d","amp;dn":"A+Bug%27s+Life%281998%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f8bff3e27c92ce481ca50d40de48abdb28ea4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,248,191,243,226,124,146,206,72,28,165,13,64,222,72,171,219,40,234,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
