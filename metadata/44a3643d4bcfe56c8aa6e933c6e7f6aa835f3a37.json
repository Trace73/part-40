However, these often remain undetected and untreated. In this book, a team of experts examines the prevalence of mental disorders in this population and describes the means of screening for, diagnosing, and treating them effectively in a developmentally appropriate, culturally sensitive manner. They also examine psychopharmacologic and psychotherapeutic approaches; innovative alternatives to detention; the true costs of detaining youth; vulnerability to self-incrimination; and the alarming trend of minority confinement. Their comprehensive coverage includes discussion of ethical dilemmas and the need for preventive strategies and integrated approaches involving judicial, law enforcement, educational, and mental health professionals. This book will be of interest to both mental health and juvenile justice professionals.\n\n# Paperback: 464 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (September 17, 2007)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 052161290X\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521612906","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a3643d4bcfe56c8aa6e933c6e7f6aa835f3a37","amp;dn":"The+Mental+Health+Needs+of+Young+Offenders+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a3643d4bcfe56c8aa6e933c6e7f6aa835f3a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,163,100,61,75,207,229,108,138,166,233,51,198,231,246,170,131,95,58,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
