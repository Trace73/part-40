It recounts the Partition of India in August 1947.\n\nInstead of depicting the Partition in terms of only the political events surrounding it, Singh digs into a deep local focus, providing a human dimension which brings to the event a sense of reality, horror, and believability.\n\n\nspoken language : Hindi\n\n\t\n\nTexted language : English \t\nby cyrexXx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03fe3155f5313324aef01186973f220b59635063","amp;dn":"train+to+pakistan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03fe3155f5313324aef01186973f220b59635063","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,254,49,85,245,49,51,36,174,240,17,134,151,63,34,11,89,99,80,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
