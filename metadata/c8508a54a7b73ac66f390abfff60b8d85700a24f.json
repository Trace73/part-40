The title cut and 'Everytime I Think of You' were radio favorites. My PERSONAL favorite is &quot;I Was One&quot;, which always stood out to me.  This is the re-mastered 2001 release.  This album is now out of print and VERY hard to find.  I hope you like it.\n\n\n1. Love Don't Prove I'm Right\n2. Everytime I Think of You\n3. I Was One\n4. White Lightning\n5. Run to Mexico\n6. Head First\n7. You (Got It)\n8. Please Don't Leave Me Here\n9. California\n\n\nAll of my rips are taken from the original CD.  Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8508a54a7b73ac66f390abfff60b8d85700a24f","amp;dn":"The+Babys+-+Head+First+%28Out+Of+Print%29+%28320+Kbps+MP3%29+%7Bsolstars%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8508a54a7b73ac66f390abfff60b8d85700a24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,80,138,84,167,183,58,198,111,57,10,191,255,96,184,216,87,0,162,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
