Although No Pocky for Kitty successfully channels the sound and spirit of punk's heyday, for all their whiplash guitars and spitfire rhythms Superchunk's songs derive their power not from nihilism and ennui but from optimism and passion -- implicit in McCaughan's lyrics is a belief in creation over destruction, hope over cynicism, and love over hate. Credit too Steve Albini's no-frills recording for the live-wire snap and crackle of standouts like &quot;Seed Toss,&quot; &quot;Punch Me Harder,&quot; and &quot;Throwing Things&quot; -- for all its earthy simplicity and everyman conviction, No Pocky for Kitty positively soars.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42a835225715158af628136730ad31d694a4d567","amp;dn":"Superchunk+-+No+Pocky+for+Kitty+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42a835225715158af628136730ad31d694a4d567","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,168,53,34,87,21,21,138,246,40,19,103,48,173,49,214,148,164,213,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
