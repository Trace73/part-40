Over the following ten years he recorded more than 54 rhythm-and-blues best-sellers. Material for his band came from a number of black and white songwriters. As Jordan's manager, Berle Adams, told Honkers and Shouters author Shaw, &quot;When we found something we liked, an arrangement would be made up, and we'd play it on onenighters. The songs the public asked for again and again were the songs we recorded.&quot; Jordan soon produced a stream of hits, including &quot;What's the Use of Getting Sober (When You're Gonna Get Drunk Again),&quot; &quot;Five Guys Named Moe,&quot; and &quot;G.I. Jive,&quot; a boogie number intended for the entertainment of troops fighting in World War II.\n\nTracklist\n\n1 Pompton Turnpike 3:07\n2 T-Bone Blues 3:07\n3 I'm Alabama Bound 2:57\n4 Deacon Jones 2:54\n5 Mop!
