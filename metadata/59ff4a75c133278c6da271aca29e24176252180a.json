It was released on April 16, 1996, almost four years after the band's first, self-titled album.\n\nThe album's title is taken from the phrase evil empire, which was used by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and many Western conservatives in describing the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe track &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; became the first single and, as with their debut, five singles were released in total.\n\nEvil Empire debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. The song &quot;Tire Me&quot; won the 1996 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance. The tracks &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; and &quot;People of the Sun&quot; were both nominated for Grammy's for Best Hard Rock Performance in separate years.\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    -  Rage Against The Machine       \nAlbum     -  Evil Empire                                          \nGenre     -  Rap metal                                             \nLabel     -  Epic Records\nYear      -  1996                                            \nTracks    -  11                                               \nPlaytime  -  n/a\nFile Type -  .mp3\nSize      -  86.4 MB\nkbps      -  256\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt;  \n                                         \nEnjoy.
