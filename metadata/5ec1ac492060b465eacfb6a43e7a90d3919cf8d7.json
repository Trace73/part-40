In The Last Season, Lakers coach Phil Jackson draws on his trademark honesty and insight to tell the whole story of the season that proved to be the final ride of a truly great dynasty. From the signing of future Hall-of-Famers Karl Malone and Gary Payton to the Kobe Bryant rape case/media circus, this is a riveting tale of clashing egos, public feuds, contract disputes, and team meltdowns that only a coach, and a writer, of JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candor, experience, and ability could tell. Full of tremendous human drama and offering lessons on coaching and on life, this is a book that no sports fan can possibly pass up.\n\n\nghost dog...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec1ac492060b465eacfb6a43e7a90d3919cf8d7","amp;dn":"Phil+Jackson+-+The+Last+Season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec1ac492060b465eacfb6a43e7a90d3919cf8d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,193,172,73,32,96,180,101,234,207,182,164,62,122,144,211,145,156,248,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
