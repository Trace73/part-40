There still is little info to find on Danish psych/prog bands. Ragnarock also is a festival which is held each year in Norway. I found out that Alrune Rod were one the most important Danish bands from &amp;#039;the 70&amp;#039;s, because they were the originators of the psychedelic movement. They released four albums or so, with a style which became more symphonic during the mid &amp;#039;70&amp;#039;s. Though the group was very popular, they sold very few of their now scarce records (which are now reissued). This is a live recording with 5 tracks, from a 16-track tape from an excellent recording quality which was only recently rediscovered after 30 years. The group had especially a live reputation, with concerts that could easily take 4 to 5 hours. The group even often kept on playing acoustically when electricity was turned of. \n\nFor this concert in Norway the group only had one hour, so they had to play more compact and fast, which they did. The music is jam driven psychedelic rock with some jazzrock touch (great sax improvisations), comparable to what some Swedish progressive rock groups did live in those days (FlÃƒÂ¤sket Brinner, Harvester,..) with songs appearing in between many terrific psychedelic jams. Band leader Leif Roden remixed the original tape, and it surely is a great discovery/document. Just the last track for me is a bit more demanding. progressive.homestead.com\n\n\nSize: 109 MB\nBitrate: 320 kbps\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - Om At\n02 - Ringene I Sandet\n03 - Flyv Fugl Fisk\n04 - De Vises Sten\n05 - Rock SÃƒÂ¸ster\n\nEnjoy &amp; please seed back!\n\n\n\nVisit my blog http://knuthulu.blogspot.com/ and download more music like this directly\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b98633f5db837b2b76b38fc009444f09d298af8e","amp;dn":"Alrune+Rod+-+Live+Ragnarock+%6074+%28Danish++Progressive+Rock+-+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b98633f5db837b2b76b38fc009444f09d298af8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,134,51,245,219,131,123,43,118,179,143,192,9,68,79,9,210,152,175,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
