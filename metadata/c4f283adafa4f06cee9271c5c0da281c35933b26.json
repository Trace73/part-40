Set in a dark, dreary purgatory, there is a struggle between\nArc and Fallen angels for control over the city of vice, violence and cruelty,\nand its population of re-born souls. At present, darkness rules and Gabriel,\nthe last of seven Arcs sent to return the light, must assume a human form for\nthe first time to wrestle the midworld away from the hands of the lead fallen\nangel 'Sammael' and his task force of gun toting followers. Gabriel is young,\nstrong an the mightiest warrior since Michael, his predecessor, who has\ndisappeared. Sammael's victory is assured throughout the film, as Gabriel\nplays into his hands, falling prey to human emotions, by tracking down and\nhealing the broken Arc angels, including the lost angel Jade who has turned\nto drugs and vice to get by. All Arc's before him have failed in their\nmission. Just when you think its getting good for Gabriel, Sammael has one\nlast card to play: the secret of his own past, the knowledge of which could\ndestroy Gabriel forever. In the darkest places of the human soul, this lone\narc angel's battle with his human feelings and emotions will prove as\nperilous as facing the Fallen.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Andy Whitfield.\n=&gt;-Dwaine Stevenson.\n=&gt;-Samantha Noble.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Shane Abbess.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Action : Fantasy : Horror.\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 2007.\n=&gt;-Language.......................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 1.01 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 1 316 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 1h 49mn.\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 720 x 304.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 1200 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 178 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f283adafa4f06cee9271c5c0da281c35933b26","amp;dn":"Gabriel+-+Action+Fantasy+Eng+Subs+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f283adafa4f06cee9271c5c0da281c35933b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,242,131,173,175,164,240,108,238,146,113,197,192,218,40,28,53,147,59,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
