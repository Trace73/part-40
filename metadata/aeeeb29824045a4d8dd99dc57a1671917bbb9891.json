Blueberry Hill\n\nPlease Note before you download: The Hiss on the main source had a high pitch sound to it that I found off putting.\nUsing a new tool for noise reduction I was able to remove that. But the after effect of doing that gave the quieter\nparts the wind tunnel effect. I prefer that over having the high pitched hiss sound throughout the whole show.\nThe Patches using the Alternate Mono - parts of those had better audio from other sources, but I used those because\nthey were complete patches, instead of using 3 different sources for 1 patch.\n\n*Artwork is included\n\nALL credit goes to the Band and the tapers.\nAnd to Javit who liberated the (5th) Stereo source and for allowing me to use it.\nAlso to blackmikito for his valuble feedback.\nRemastering is just a hobby. This release is never meant to be definitive\n\nPlease do not sell\nPlease do not sell\nPlease do not sell\n\nWR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aeeeb29824045a4d8dd99dc57a1671917bbb9891","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1970-09-04+-+The+Forum%2C+Inglewood%2C+CA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aeeeb29824045a4d8dd99dc57a1671917bbb9891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,238,178,152,36,4,90,77,141,217,157,197,122,22,113,145,123,187,152,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
