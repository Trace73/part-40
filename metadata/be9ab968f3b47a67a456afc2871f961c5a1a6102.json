This means, for example, that I find Her Voice by Builder to be the number one track, Da Bomba by Da Tweekaz the second best, et cetera. Of course, this is all my opinion and around the 10-40 mark it's kinda unclear because I'm lazy and could be arsed to sort them detailed.\n\nAll tracks have sexy tags. They all have artist and track title mp3 tags.\n\nI also wanted to avoid to upload too much of the mainstream songs, that's why Project One -  The Art Of Creation and 2 Best Enemies - Phases among with other tracks that's in every mix in existance since 2008 aren't included, mkay?\n\nOh yeah this is mostly nu-style, I guess... Teehee.\n\nBasically, I took the best versions of the tracks possible I had. This means 320kbps over VBRkbps and 192kbps if possible. I also tried taking the full versions of the tracks.\nAnyways, enough with the formalities, enjoy your hardstyle and seed well... I mean, it's just music, have fun!\n\nfratey\n\n:::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nTracklist (In order)\nBuilder - Her Voice\nDa Tweekaz - Da Bomba\nDa Tweekaz - Daydre4m\nThe Pitcher - Serenity\nWilliams Syndrome - Emotions\nThe Pitcher - Karma\nNagoom - Atmosphere\nThe Beholder meets Zany - Euphoria\nThe Prophet - The Force (Defqon 2007)\nThe Pitcher &amp; MC DV8 - Shine\nThe Beholder &amp; Zany - Bleeding For The Harder Styles\nTeequee - Popcorn\nBrennan Heart - Remember Remember\nWildstylez - The Moon\nThe Masochist - LDMF (Wildstylez Remix)\nThe Pitcher - Underwater\nDozer - Relax\nWildstylez &amp; The Prophet - Cold Rockkin' (Fine, I uploaded the short version by accident but I'm sure you'll survive)\nThe Pitcher - Our Core\nShowtek - Down Under\nProject One - Life Beyond Earth\nNoisecontrollers - Bassleader Anthem 2008\nCharly Lownoise And Mental Theo - Wonderful Days 20.8 (Showtek Remix)\nSkyscaper - Paradise\nDJ Isaac - The Afterworld (Dub Mix)\nTNT - Double Dutch Darkies\nPavo &amp; Blutonium Boy - Echoes 2009\nLuna Meets Trilok &amp; Chiren - Street Knowledge (Beat Provider Remix)\nHeadhunterz - Hate It Or Love It\nTechnoboy - Vita\nKlone - Dragon's Lair (Builder Remix)\nTechnoboy - Ti Sento (Original Mix)\nBuilder - My Life Is Just A Demo (WJ Mix)\nDJ Gius - Scrubs\nNoisecontrollers - Attack Again\nCoone vs Deepack - Mayday Dream (Original Mix)\nFlarup - Hardstyle Ambassadors (Blutonium Boy Short Cut)\nNagoom - H.A.A.R.P\nNoisecontrollers - Hocus Pocus\nThe Raiders - A Feeling\nDeepack And Frontliner Feat.
