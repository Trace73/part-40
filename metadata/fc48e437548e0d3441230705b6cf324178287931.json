Full Descriptioncountry music. With this album, they upped the ante for the 21st century. Enlisting hot producer Mark Wright (who has worked with Lee Ann Womack and Clint Black), the band took seven months to record STEERS &amp; STRIPES. Instead of doing a quickie recording session then heading out on tour, Brooks &amp; Dunn really took their time on this one, and their efforts payed off with this phenomenal country-pop crossover album. \n\nTrisha Yearwood lends her fabulous vocal power on &quot;The Last Thing I Do.&quot; &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; is a tug-at-your-heartstrings ballad complete with gorgeous strings. &quot;My Heart Is Lost To You&quot; is a pledge of love that goes in a slight Latin direction. &quot;Lucky Me, Lonely You&quot; is one of the few traditional country tunes on the album, as STEERS &amp; STRIPES is dominated by country-rock/pop and tender ballads. All in all, these heartfelt tunes are some of the strongest the boys have released. \n\nAdditional personnel includes: Brent Rowan (acoustic &amp; electric guitar); B. James Lowry (acoustic guitar); J.T. Corenflos, Kenny Greenberg (electric guitar); Paul Franklin (steel guitar, dobro); Dan Dugmore (steel guitar); Greg Davis (banjo); Aubrey Haynie (fiddle); The Nashville String Machine (strings); Steve Nathan (piano, Hammond B-3 organ, keyboards, synthesizer); Michael Rhodes (bass); Shannon Forrest (drums); Eric Darken (percussion); Bob Bailey, Kim Fleming, Vicki Hampton, Gene Miller, Kim Richey, John Wesley Ryles, Chris Rodriguez, Harry Stinson, Trisha Yearwood. \n\nRecorded at House Of Gain, Oceanway, Cyber Ranch, Nashville, Tennessee, Sound Kitchen Studios, Franklin, Tennessee. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.torrentbox.com:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thetracker.org:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrent-downloads.to:2710/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://denis.stalker.h3q.com:6969/announce&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumotracker.com/announce&lt;/a&gt;  \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc48e437548e0d3441230705b6cf324178287931","amp;dn":"Brooks+%26+Dunn+-+Steers+%26+Stripes%28EAC+FLAC%29+ResourceRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc48e437548e0d3441230705b6cf324178287931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,72,228,55,84,142,13,52,65,35,7,5,182,207,50,65,120,40,121,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
