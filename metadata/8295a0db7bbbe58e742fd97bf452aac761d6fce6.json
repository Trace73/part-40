Carlton (Ada, MI United States)\nThere's not much doubt that this is the best live album ever recorded by anybody....ever. Duane died shortly after these recordings, so this is an album without comparison in all of rock.....this is THE live rock album.......nobody ever came close again.......one of the best Bands that ever existed, captured blazing hot just before their lights would dim forever. What else can you say?.....Duane and Dickey are brilliant, Gregg spectacular, but the set is historic because Jai Johanny and Butch Trucks never stop while Berry Oakley keeps the bottom running full tilt regardless of where Dickey and the Allmans are flying at any given moment.\nIf you are entranced by this music (and how could anyone not be?), you should consider getting one of the full Fillmore East sets (the famous hall really DID have a great sound, much better than the Kinetic Playground in Chicago, Fillmore West, or any of the others....I remember them very well). The reviews of the surround sound remixes are varied.....many people don't like having Duane and Dickey behind them......so my advice is to read the reviews before you buy.\n\nNo matter what you decide, I would strongly urge you to consider this album because it is THE historic mix, THE memorable sequencing, THIS ONE is what made that night in 71 famous, and for that reason alone this album should be in everyone's collection. Just buy the damn thing and love it like the rest of us.&quot;\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
