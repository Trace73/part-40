The night before Christmas, Danny and Uncle Nick make an amazing discovery -- Santa Claus has designed a new, state-of-the-art sleigh, and Danny and Nick can't resist the temptation to take it out for a ride. But once they head out, the question becomes: can they get the sleigh back in one piece -- and in time for Santa to deliver his toys?\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal Air Date: 07-Dec-2001\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nResolution: 640 x 478\r\nAspect ratio: 1.33891\r\nFormat: H264\r\nBitrate: 917 kbps\r\nFrames: 23.976\r\nSelected codec: ffh264\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat: MP4A\r\nBitrate: 118 kbps\r\nRate: 48000 Hz\r\nChannels: 2\r\nSelected codec: ffaac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda915f55619a49df719f2b2a4af41c92ca1e5fe","amp;dn":"Twas+the+Night+2001+Disney+PDTV.x264-REGRET","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda915f55619a49df719f2b2a4af41c92ca1e5fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,169,21,245,86,25,164,157,247,25,242,178,164,175,65,201,44,161,229,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
