Sure, all this connectivity keeps you in touch with your team and the officeÃ¢â‚¬â€but at what cost?\n\nIn Sleeping with Your Smartphone, Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow reveals how you can disconnect and become more productive in the process. In fact, she shows that you can devote more time to your personal life and accomplish more at work.\n\nThe good news is that this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t require a grand organizational makeover or buy-in from the CEO. All it takes is collaboration between you and your teamÃ¢â‚¬â€working together and making small, doable changes.\n\nWhat started as an experiment with a six-person team at The Boston Consulting GroupÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elite management consulting firmsÃ¢â‚¬â€triggered a global initiative that eventually spanned more than nine hundred BCG teams in thirty countries across five continents. These teams confronted their nonstop workweeks and changed the way they worked, becoming more efficient and effective.\n\nThe result? Employees were more satisfied with their work-life balance and with their work in general. And the firm was better able to recruit and retain employees. Clients also benefitedÃ¢â‚¬â€often in unexpected ways.\n\nIn this engaging book, Perlow takes you inside BCG to witness the challenges and benefits of disconnecting. She provides a step-by-step guide to introducing change on your teamÃ¢â‚¬â€by establishing a collective goal, encouraging open dialogue, ensuring leadership supportÃ¢â‚¬â€and then spreading change to the rest of your firm.\n\nIf you and your colleagues are grappling with the Ã¯Â¿Â½always onÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ problem, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time to disconnectÃ¢â‚¬â€and start reading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a31077054ee0a53aa0ebb54deaf4bcf24802668","amp;dn":"Sleeping+With+Your+Smart+Phone+-+Leslie+Perlow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a31077054ee0a53aa0ebb54deaf4bcf24802668","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,49,7,112,84,238,10,83,170,14,187,84,222,175,75,207,36,128,38,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
