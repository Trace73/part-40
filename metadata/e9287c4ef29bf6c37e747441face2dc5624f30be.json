This is Casey Kasem and the countdown continues.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nCasey informs that the song &quot;Maybe&quot; by The Three Degrees (at number 35) is a remake of a hit by The Chantels from 1957, and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; by The Who (at number 33) was first done by Eddie Cochran in 1958, and then by Blue Cheer in 1968.\n\nWith only 112 hit songs to his name, the soon-to-be-popular Elvis is at number 24 with &quot;The Wonder Of You.&quot;\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young has back-to-back hits with &quot;Ohio&quot; and &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; (at numbers 17 and 16).\n\nThere is a band named War with their hit &quot;Spill The Wine&quot; (at number 7) and a song called &quot;War&quot; (by Edwin Star at number 12).\n\nAnd from the department of RocketMan FYI: This was one of the first AT40 shows ever broadcast. The program was distributed in mono until September 1972 when the show started recording in stereo. However, as you listen, you may notice the songs in this broadcast (and other rebroadcasts from the mono period) are in stereo. If anyone is bothered by the alteration of this precious piece of history, just unplug one speaker and you will never know the difference!\n\n40: Check Out Your Mind - The Impressions\n39: Do You See My Love - Junior Walker &amp; the All-Stars\n38: 25 Or 6 To 4 - Chicago\n37: Everybody's Got A Right To Love - The Supremes\n36: Mississippi - John Phillips\n35: Maybe - The Three Degrees\n34: The Sly, The Slick And The Wicked - The Lost Generation\n33: Summertime Blues - The Who\n32: Loveland - Charles Wright &amp; The Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band\n31: Mississippi Queen - Mountain\n30: (I Feel Like A) Sex Machine - James Brown\n29: Patches - Clarence Carter\n28: Overture From &quot;Tommy&quot; - The Assembled Multitude\n27: Tell It All Brother - Kenny Rogers &amp; The First Edition\nOLDIE: I'm Walkin' - Fats Domino\n26: Westbound #9 - Flaming Ember\n25: Silver Bird - Mark Lindsey\n24: The Wonder Of You - Elvis Presley\n23: Gimme Dat Ding - The Pipkins\nOLDIE: Can't Buy Me Love - The Beatles\n22: In The Summertime - Mungo Jerry\n21: Why Can't I Touch You - Ronnie Dyson\n20: A Song Of Joy - Miguel Rios\n19: Lay A Little Lovin' On Me - Robin McNamara\n18: I Just Can't Help Believing - B.J.
