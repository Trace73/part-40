Among The Breather's weapons of choice are paper clips, eggplants, and wooden horse-head bookends, and one of the murders is committed to commemorate Jamie Lee Curtis's birthday. Student Bodies was written and directed by Mickey Rose, who previously collaborated with Woody Allen on the screenplays for several of Allen's early films. The film had a notoriously difficult production and producer Michael Ritchie (best known as director of such films as The Candidate and Downhill Racer) opted to take his name off the picture, instead using the Director's Guild pseudonym Alan Smithee. \n\nBROUGHT TO YOU BY CLOWNSEC * HONK *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2ed647767e506249dfa12a1415c898c6ce73c17","amp;dn":"Student+Bodies+%281981%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+CLOWNSEC+%28PhreakyFlix%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2ed647767e506249dfa12a1415c898c6ce73c17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,237,100,119,103,229,6,36,157,250,18,161,65,92,137,140,108,231,60,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
