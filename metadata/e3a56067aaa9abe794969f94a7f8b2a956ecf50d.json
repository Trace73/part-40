This is a worldview that, as Elgin  :\n : explains, is shared by virtually every spiritual tradition, and the        :\n : implications of it are vast and deep. In a living system each part is      :\n : integral to the whole, so each of us is intimately connected to the entire :\n : universe. Elgin eloquently demonstrates how that identity manifests itself :\n : on a whole series of levels, from subatomic to galactic. We are, he writes,:\n : far more than biological beings; we are beings of cosmic connection and    :\n : dimension.                                                                 :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3a56067aaa9abe794969f94a7f8b2a956ecf50d","amp;dn":"Duane+Elgin+The+Living+Universe+2011+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3a56067aaa9abe794969f94a7f8b2a956ecf50d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,165,96,103,170,169,171,231,148,150,159,148,167,248,178,169,86,236,245,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
