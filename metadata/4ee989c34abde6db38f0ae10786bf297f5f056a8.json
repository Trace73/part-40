This is her second most recent album behind Future Noir and was released in 2003. Musically, much of this album lacks the smoother feel of Future Noir and you can expect to get much more of an industrial noise feel from it, with good usage of heavy distortion and overamplification.\n\nVBR averages range from 164 to 271 with an average of about 243 for all of the files.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ee989c34abde6db38f0ae10786bf297f5f056a8","amp;dn":"Hanin+Elias+-+No+Games+No+Fun+%28MP3-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ee989c34abde6db38f0ae10786bf297f5f056a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,233,137,195,74,189,230,219,56,240,174,16,120,107,242,151,245,240,86,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
