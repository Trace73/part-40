This is a declaration against worldly intelligentsia by a man who was exposed to the philosophers, the scientists, and the religionists, and rejected them all when he had an encounter with the risen Saviour through His Book. This is Dr. RuckmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s statement that he has just as low an opinion of the scholars and intellects of this world (saved or lost) as they have of the Bible and those who believe it. This work discusses the definition, characteristics, mindset, and enemy of the scholars. The real Biblical scholars are identified, and they are distinguished from men who are considered to be Biblical scholars but are only Bible critics. As in all of Dr. RuckmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works, the Authorized Version is held up as the final authority and the only true source of wisdom and knowledge.\n\n\nDr. Peter S. Ruckman received his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alabama and finished his formal education with six years of training at Bob Jones University (four full years and two accelerated summer sessions), completing requirements for the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degree.\nReading at a rate of seven hundred words per minute, Dr. Ruckman had managed to read about 6,500 books before receiving his doctorate, and he still reads an average of a book each day.\nDr. Ruckman stands for the absolute authority of the Authorized Version and offers no apology to any recognized scholar anywhere for his stand. In addition to preaching the gospel and teaching the Bible, Dr. Ruckman has produced a comprehensive collection of apologetic and polemic literature and resources supporting the authority of the Authorized Version of the Holy Scriptures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7369f59664e37ef66629684aa78c94497d9580c6","amp;dn":"The+Anti-Intellectual+Manifesto+-+Dr.+Peter+S.+Ruckman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7369f59664e37ef66629684aa78c94497d9580c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,105,245,150,100,227,126,246,102,41,104,74,167,140,148,73,125,149,128,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
