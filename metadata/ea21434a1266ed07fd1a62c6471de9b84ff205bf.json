P. Putnam's Sons. It details the story of a fictitious Sicilian Mafia family based in New York City (and Long Beach, New York) and headed by Don Vito Corleone, who became synonymous with the Italian Mafia. The novel covers the years 1945 to 1955, and also provides the back story of Vito Corleone from early childhood to adulthood.\n\nThe book introduced Italian criminal terms like consiglieri, caporegime, Cosa Nostra, and omertÃƒÂ  to an English-speaking audience.\n\nIt formed the basis for a 1972 film of the same name. Two film sequels, including new contributions by Puzo himself, were made in 1974 and 1990. The first and second films are widely considered to be two of the greatest films of all time.\n\nThe cover was created by S. Neil Fujita whose design featured a large Gothic-style letter &quot;G&quot; with a long curl at the top emphasizing the first three letters of the title, accompanied by the hands of a puppeteer holding a set of strings over the &quot;father&quot; portion of the word.\n\nThis book is one my personal favorites. Tell me if you didn't enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea21434a1266ed07fd1a62c6471de9b84ff205bf","amp;dn":"Mario+Puzo-The+Godfather.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea21434a1266ed07fd1a62c6471de9b84ff205bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,33,67,74,18,102,237,7,253,26,98,198,71,29,233,184,79,242,5,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
