Sonic Syndicate is a modern metal band from Falkenberg, Sweden. They are influenced by Swedish melodic death metal bands such as In Flames and Soilwork and American metalcore bands like Killswitch Engage and All That Remains.\n\nThe band was founded in 2002 by brothers Richard (vocals) and Roger Sjunnesson (guitars) with their younger cousin Robin Sjunnesson (guitars) under the name Fallen Angels, finally switching to Sonic Syndicate in 2004. As of today the band consists of Robin (now the only original member) alongside British singer Nathan J. Biggs, bass player Karin Axelsson and drummer John Bengtsson.         Love and Other Disasters (2008-2009)\n\nIn March 2008, the band began recording their third release in Jonas Kjellgren's Black Lounge Studios in Avesta. In May 2008, Sonic Syndicate returned to North America as the opening act for Nightwish. In the June 2008, the magazine Revolver named Karin Axelsson the &quot;Hottest Chick in Metal&quot;. Love and Other Disasters was released in September 2008. The first single, &quot;Jack of Diamonds&quot;, is accompanied by a video again from Patric Ullaeus who has directed all of the band's videos. Not long after, the second single &quot;My Escape&quot; would follow up, also accompanied by a video from Patric Ullaeus. At the end of the year, the band toured Germany and Scandinavia, and released the singles &quot;Power Shift&quot; and &quot;Contradiction&quot; directed by Marius BÃƒÂ¶ttcher of Quent Film.\nOn March 30, 2009, it was confirmed that singer Roland Johansson would quit the band because of personal reasons. A search for a replacement immediately went underway, whilst Roland stayed in the band until August 29, the day of his last show with the band at the Geuzenpop Festival in Enschede, Netherlands (five days after Nathan J. Biggs was announced as the new singer).\n\nOn October 13, Roland Johansson expounded in an interview that his reason for leaving Sonic Syndicate was that he felt severe anxiety and dislike for the lifestyle that went with having to tour all around the world and not being able to spend much time with his loved ones. He also shared that he and Jesper StrÃƒÂ¶mblad (formerly of In Flames) are currently working on an unnamed project, and would start recording an album in the beginning of 2010 (although as of April 2011 there has still been no sign of any material from the two).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a7a35092e48cf2516415aaf3a381f52488c4ff3","amp;dn":"Sonic+Syndicate+-+Love+And+Other+Disasters+%28Limited+Edition%29+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a7a35092e48cf2516415aaf3a381f52488c4ff3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,122,53,9,46,72,207,37,22,65,90,175,58,56,31,82,72,140,79,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
