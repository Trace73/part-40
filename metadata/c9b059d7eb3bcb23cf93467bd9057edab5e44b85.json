How far away, and whether or not that cradle of civilization still exists, is a mystery. Humans arrived through a natural wormhole and, gazing up upon an alien sky they had never seen, were completely unable to determine where this new world was located. From the New Eden solar system, where the gate of EVE once led to the old world, humans expanded in all directions at a furious pace, exploring and colonizing rapidly.\n\nThen, unexpectedly and seemingly unprovoked, the EVE gate collapsed in an apocalyptic catastrophe of a scale never before witnessed by the human race, ruining the New Eden system in the process. Thousands of small colonies were left in complete isolation to fend for themselves, cut off from the old world. For millennia they endured, clinging to the brink of extinction, and only a handful managed to survive.\n\nOf those that lasted, five were to rise up and become the major empires that, between them, hold the balance of power in the world of EVE. Today, they are known as the Amarr Empire, the Gallente Federation, the Caldari State, the Minmatar Republic, and the Jovian Empire. Additionally, the world is full of several small, independent factions and states.\n\nFor more than a century, the five empires have lived together in relative peace. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve continually strived to maintain this peace, as each faction realizes only too well the grave consequences of a massive inter-stellar war. Recent technological breakthroughs in FTL travel, and the ensuing increase in space travelers, have shaken, but not broken, the fragile peace... at least not yet.\n\n\nenjoy the music from Jan Hallur.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9b059d7eb3bcb23cf93467bd9057edab5e44b85","amp;dn":"Music+from+Eve+Online+by+Jon+Hallur","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9b059d7eb3bcb23cf93467bd9057edab5e44b85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,176,89,215,235,59,203,35,207,147,70,123,217,5,126,218,181,228,75,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
