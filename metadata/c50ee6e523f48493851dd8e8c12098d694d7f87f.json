There are even brainwave-controlled meditation games. The programme also reveals what a fully automated house is like, with everything from the blinds and the lights to the music and the TV controlled from a 'smart' device. And forget about a front door key; the house now has a computer-controlled thumb print door entry system! For the first time, youngest son Leon gets a space all to himself - a bedroom in the garden - while mum Michele tries out the latest driver-aided cars, which do the difficult job of parallel parking for her, and presenter Chris finds out about the future of driverless cars. There are also robot lawnmowers that cut the grass by themselves and a mini power station installed in the house to provide electricity for the new technological toys.\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 1939 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 416\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 46.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 5\nPart Size: 701 MB\nEncoded by: Harry65\nSource: PDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c50ee6e523f48493851dd8e8c12098d694d7f87f","amp;dn":"Ch4.Home.Of.The.Future.1of5.PDTV.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c50ee6e523f48493851dd8e8c12098d694d7f87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,14,230,229,35,244,132,147,133,29,216,232,193,32,152,214,148,215,248,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
