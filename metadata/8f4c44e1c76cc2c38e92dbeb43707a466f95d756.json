But in what had to be one of the most clearly deserved acts of karmic compensation, the LBPD recovered their magic Econoline just in time for Crystal Antlers to mess with Texas. Then, the band only had two 45s to its name, including a first 7ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that started strong with the Guru Guru guitars of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParting Song for the Torn SkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and finished stronger with a nearly Blue Cheer-besting cover of Mose AllisonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œParchman Farm.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Now Tentacles, the AntlersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ debut full-length as well as the gum-studded end of Touch and Go, falls into familiar groovesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½songs that fly by on Comets on Fire-like orbits between heavy breaths from the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bottom-end. When a song occasionally drops back to solid ground, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fired back up again by a burst of propulsive drums or some well-timed keyboards, bumped up on the likes of synth-stuttering opener ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPainless Sleep,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGlacierÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and others. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the burnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Dust,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAndrewÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTentaclesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that provide the real power, sending the album off onto a crucial course.\n\nAudio: 256kbps\n\n\nHave a listen At: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Antlers&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Antlers&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f4c44e1c76cc2c38e92dbeb43707a466f95d756","amp;dn":"Crystal+Antlers+-+Tentacles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f4c44e1c76cc2c38e92dbeb43707a466f95d756","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,76,68,225,199,108,194,195,142,146,219,235,67,112,122,70,111,149,215,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
