The album is unique from other compilations because it has the vibes of true trance regardless of bpm. Today, we find ourselves surrounded with cheesy and generic tunes falsy classified as trance or infamously known around the world as EDM. The complex elements, the progressive and slow buildups, pure emotion has been missing lately. Many DJ/Producers who used to make really soul soothing trance tunes have changed their production styles and dub &quot;Electro and Big Room&quot; as &quot;Trance&quot; to the newer and younger generation. I don't blame them, because they too have families to feed. After all, living fulltime on music requires a good sum of money as earnings. But, they shouldnt misguide the newer fans of trance by labelling something which isn't trance as 'trance'. Today, many true trance fans feel cheated because their favourite DJ/Producer suddenly quit producing trance. I too felt the same way. After all, I have always been a fan first, then a DJ. So, I chose the standout and quality, soul touching trance tracks from 2013-14 and mixed them in this compilation album. This mix album is specially tailored for the fans of vocal &amp; progressive trance. I am sure u are really going to like it. Enjoy !\n\n\nTracklist :\n\n01.
