Though he never expects to get rich, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fared well enough to stay comfortable with his quirky metaphysical store, ShoemakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Magick Shoppe. But when the economy falls on hard times, his store pays the price. As each month passes, slow sales turn into no sales, and soon LoganÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s living off ramen noodles and sleeping in a freezing house during the cold winter nights as he struggles to make ends meet. His personal life isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much betterÃ¢â‚¬â€the worse business at the store grows, the more isolated and lonely he becomes. After a string of mishaps that wipe out the last of his small savings, he finally hits rock bottom the day he discovers the disconnection notice from the electric company hanging on his door. That night, desperate and in despair, he makes a plea to the universe, asking for help. \nNeedless to say, he never anticipates receiving a response so quickly. Not only does he awaken the next morning to find on his kitchen table four little bottles of a special potion labeled Ã¢â‚¬Å“PASSION,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but he keeps remembering the erotically charged dream heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d had during the night. A dream where a tall, gorgeous man with pointed ears comes to his bed and shows him just what kind of magick they can make together. \nBut was it a dream? All Logan knows is that his customers canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get enough of the special potionÃ¢â‚¬â€an aphrodisiacÃ¢â‚¬â€and he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop thinking about the sweet seduction of the nighttime visitor who made it. As he tries to sort out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s real and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not, he discovers thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a much bigger world out there than heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever believed, and his true heartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desire might come in a most unexpected form... \n\nPassion #2 (Passion #1) \nAs the owner and CEO of his own company, Robert Bauer has spent the past fifteen years building his business into a multi-million-dollar corporation. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken all his time and energy, which hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t left much room for a personal life, especially a love life. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fine with Robert because he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe in the &quot;L word&quot; anyway. Lately, however, every time he goes to his favorite bar, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep his eyes and thoughts off Jesse McIntyre, the gorgeous bartender with the soulful blue eyes. Even though RobertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not looking for a relationship, and tries to shake the attraction, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the younger man out of system. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just one problem...he believes JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straight. \nJesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been on the run from his old life for the past two and a half years. Even though he slings drinks at a gay bar, he has a hard and fast rule about never hooking up with customers. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been down that road before, and though his physical wounds have healed, the emotional ones arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t so easy to forget. He lets his customers assume heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straight because it makes it easier to keep his distance. That is, until the businessman with the sexy smile starts coming into the bar. JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawn to Robert, even though he knows thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way a wealthy, powerful man like that would ever be interested in a tattooed, college drop-out, bad-boy like him. But even if Robert werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t his opposite, it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter anyway, because JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined not to break his rules for anyone. \nWhen fate throws them together, and they find themselves alone for a weekend, the passion that has silently simmered for months ignites a firestorm that leaves them both shaken. Will it be enough, though, to convince Robert, whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sworn to never fall in love, that he might be pushing away the best thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever happened to him? Or to force Jesse to face his fears once and for all and learn to trust his heart? \n\nSatisfaction#3 (Passion #2):\nAlthough Jesse McIntyre slings drinks in a gay bar, up until recently, he kept to himself and stuck to his rule never to hook up with customers. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been down that road before and bore the physical and emotional scars from it. The last thing heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d wanted was to fall for Robert Bauer, the wealthy businessman with the sexy smile who started frequenting the bar. They were opposites in every way, so Jesse never dreamed Robert, the pressed and polished owner and CEO of a multi-million dollar corporation, might be interested in a tattooed, college drop-out bad boy like him. But when fate threw them together for a long weekend, they finally gave into the passion that had been brewing, and the resulting explosion rocked their worlds. \nNow, five months later, though the fireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still burning sinfully hot between them, the realities of their opposite lifestyles begin to take a toll. RobertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s constant business travel weighs heavily on Jesse. When he realizes theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re having more phone sex than real sex, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sleeping alone the majority of the time despite the fact he and Robert are supposedly living together, he worries thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more behind RobertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trips than just business. JesseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure RobertÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s avoiding him, avoiding them, but through the years his lover has built so many thick, protective walls to guard his emotions, Jesse finds it tough to get past them and discover why. He loves the man like crazy, and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t doubt Robert loves him, too, yet will love be enough to overcome whatever is haunting Robert and heal the rift thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s slowly tearing them apart? \n\nWanting # 4 (Campus Hearts #1)\nIt started with one kiss. Which led to another. And another. And then to a mind-blowing night of intimacy Jeremy Reynolds canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget. He canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop thinking about the gorgeous, smart, compassionate man who tilted his world. CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop seeing warm, sexy eyes gazing at him with breath-stealing intensity. \nJeremy tries to tell himself to let the incident go, move on, and chalk it up to a life experience. After all, what transpired between him and his best friend and roommate, Ben Cross, can never happen again. Ben is gay, and Jeremy...isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. At least heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never thought he was before. But now heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s torn and confused and not sure what the night with Ben meantÃ¢â‚¬â€for either of them. Already stressed about final exams before the holidays and his difficult family situation, Jeremy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to deal with the conflicting feelings heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having. And the one person heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been able to talk to about everything, and whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always been there for him, is the very person heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been avoiding for the past week because he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to face him after waking up in his bed. \nAfraid he might have already screwed up his and BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friendship beyond repair, Jeremy is haunted even more by the backlash he could face if he admits to Ben, or even to himself, how much the night they spent together really meant to him. \nAnd how much he still wants Ben even now..\n\nThe Truth About Al #5 (Campus Hearts #2)\nTo most, Al BaxterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life seems charmedÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got looks, smarts, friends, and is headed to law school in the fall. But under the surface, things are far from perfect. AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother is pursuing a career in national politics, and when her staff uncovers a potentially devastating secret AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been keeping from his family for the past four years, a painful rift forms in the once close-knit Baxter clan. Wanting to do the right thing to support his motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career, but conflicted over his growing desire to live his life in the open on his own terms, the last thing AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expecting, or needs, is to fall for stubborn and oh-so-serious Elliot Cullimore. Especially since Elliot has a protective fortress the size of Texas built around his heart. \nRaised by a struggling single mother, Elliot Cullimore learned early that nothing in life was easy. That truth hit home when, at the age of twelve, a life-threatening illness left him partially deaf, making his teenage years difficult as he learned to cope with his new reality. Now, he works long hours to put himself through college. And he holds no illusions about ever finding love. He knows from painful experience that being a nerdy, hard-of-hearing guy doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exactly make him a hot commodity. When he meets Al Baxter, however, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blindsided by his feelings for the man. The trouble is, Al is exactly the type of guy Elliot swore heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never be withÃ¢â‚¬â€rich, entitled, and one who has always had everything he ever wanted fall at his feet. And worse, AlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hiding who he really is and pretending to be something heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not. How can Elliot trust his heart to a man who canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live his own life with honesty? \nBut for the first time, Al finally knows what he wants, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to fight for Elliot. Even if it means risking everything...
