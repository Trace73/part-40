Near the body, police have found a baffling cipher. Solving the enigmatic riddle, Langdon is stunned to discover it leads to a trail of clues hidden in the works of Da VinciÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦clues visible for all to seeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.\n\nLangdon joins forces with a gifted French cryptologist, Sophie Neveu, and learns the late curator was involved in the Priory of SionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an actual secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Botticelli, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci, among others. The Louvre curator has sacrificed his life to protect the Priory&amp;#039;s most sacred trust: the location of a vastly important religious relic, hidden for centuries.\n\nIn a breathless race through Paris, London, and beyond, Langdon and Neveu match wits with a faceless powerbroker who appears to work for Opus DeiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a clandestine, Vatican-sanctioned Catholic sect believed to have long plotted to seize the Priory&amp;#039;s secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle in time, the Priory&amp;#039;s secretÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and a stunning historical truthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½will be lost forever.\n\nIn an exhilarating blend of relentless adventure, scholarly intrigue, and cutting wit, symbologist Robert Langdon (first introduced in Dan Brown&amp;#039;s bestselling Angels &amp; Demons) is the most original character to appear in years. THE DA VINCI CODE heralds the arrival of a new breed of lightening-paced, intelligent thrillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦surprising at every twist, absorbing at every turn, and in the end, utterly unpredictableÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦right up to its astonishing conclusion.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a789d430e1f4e3c8c16eb830b28e2f0b908c49a5","amp;dn":"The+Da+Vinci+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a789d430e1f4e3c8c16eb830b28e2f0b908c49a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,137,212,48,225,244,227,200,193,110,184,48,178,142,47,11,144,140,73,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
