He never thought he would meet the girl of his dreams, Lena Duchannes, who unveiled a secretive, powerful, and cursed side of Gatlin, hidden in plain sight. And he never could have expected that he would be forced to leave behind everyone and everything he cares about. So when Ethan awakes after the chilling events of the Eighteenth Moon, he has only one goal: to find a way to return to Lena and the ones he loves.\n\nBack in Gatlin, Lena is making her own bargains for Ethan's return, vowing to do whatever it takes - even if that means trusting old enemies or risking the lives of the family and friends Ethan left to protect.\n\nWorlds apart, Ethan and Lena must once again work together to rewrite their fate, in this fourth book and stunning finale to the Beautiful Creatures series.\n\n\nConverted using SoundTaxi 128kbps ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd51096ee793bb41bfe9911aab1065d1a28ebc49","amp;dn":"Kami+Garcia%2C+Margaret+Stohl+Beautiful+Redemption+%28BC+Book+4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd51096ee793bb41bfe9911aab1065d1a28ebc49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,81,9,110,231,147,187,65,191,233,145,26,171,16,101,209,162,142,188,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
