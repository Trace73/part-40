Recorded in November 2004, just after the reelection of George W Bush, Chomsky pinpoints the principle commitments of the current administration. In the name of expanding markets and controlling access to key natural resources weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen the blatant undermining of democratic practice, contempt for binding International Law, restriction of civil liberties, and the use of war crimes to further foreign policy objectives. This is not another cataloging of the offenses and blunders committed by George W. Bush, but a lively chronicle of the systematic power plays which have effectively wrenched power from citizensÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ hands and made the world an increasingly unstable place to inhabit. \n\nNoam Chomsky is an influential linguist, professor, author, and activist. Chomsky has been active in left-wing politics and he opposed the Vietnam War. He is the eighth most cited source of all time, and is considered the ''most cited living author''. Chomsky is also the author of over 150 books.\n\n\nRunning Time: 1:03:05\n\n\n1  History and the ''Second Superpower''\n2  Controlling the ''Great Beast''\n3  Rescinding the Geneva Convention\n4  Demystifying ''Pre-Emptive War''\n5  The Principle of Universality\n6  Polling the ''Great Beast'' of Public Opinion\n7  The ''Threat of Terrorism'' vs the Real U.S. Priorities\n8  What the ''Great Beast'' Wants and Why it is Deceived\n9  What is ''Old Europe'' Anyway?\n10 America's Messianic Vision of Democracy\n11 Making Use of Our Freedom to Fight Back\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000A2H71S/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000A2H71S/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&amp;n=5174&amp;s=music&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cc8e16dceafa75ae61163017de191d10966f059","amp;dn":"Noam+Chomsky+-+Imperial+Presidency+-+Sovereignty+Terror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cc8e16dceafa75ae61163017de191d10966f059","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,200,225,109,206,175,167,90,230,17,99,1,125,225,145,209,9,102,240,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
