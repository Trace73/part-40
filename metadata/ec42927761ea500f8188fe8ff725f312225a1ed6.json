He returns to Poughkeepsie remembering how he and David always attended the premiers of Star Trek movies. David's love of drugs and music cause Owen to worry overly about him.\n\nThis book is like a series of memory recalls, moving back and forth between the past and the present. There are other synopsis and reviews out there, but they're too detailed. I think the less you know, the better with this one.
