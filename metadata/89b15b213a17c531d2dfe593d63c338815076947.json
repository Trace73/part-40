At the helm of the album is the self-conscious 20-something singer/songwriter Max Bemis, who ultimately is Say Anything: he wrote and plays pretty much everything but percussion on the record. The songs were originally written as part of a play, complete with a cast of characters, full story, and spoken interludes. A rise-and-fall plot of sorts, the story line was to be: a band is mediocre until its idealistic frontman (who also suffers from alienation and anxiety in a world of hypocrisy) becomes cursed to spew his innermost thoughts in the form of honest songs that alter the band into wildly popular stars before their own hypocrisy leads to their undoing. And though the proposed story line didnt completely transfer to the album, its almost too easy to see parallels between the real band and the made-up one, envisioning Bemis (with his own history of anxiety, depression, and paranoia) as the actual hyper-aware lead character. Sure, one could look at this album as self-indulgent, overzealous, and egocentric, but when the songs are as catchy, cutting, and enjoyable as these, it really doesnt matter. \n\nRelease Notes\n\n  Released.......: 2004, 2006 (Reissue)\n  Genre..........: Rock\n  Style..........: Indie, Alternative, Punk-Pop\n  Source.........: CD\n  Codec..........: FLAC\n  Channels.......: Stereo\n  Sample Rate....: 44,100 Hz\n  Bit Rate.......: ~1,000 kbps\n  Bits per Sample: 16\n  Covers.........: Front \n\n  Tracks\n \n  Disc 1 ...Is A Real Boy\n\n  01.
