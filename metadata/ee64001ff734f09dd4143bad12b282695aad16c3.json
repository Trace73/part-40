Contains guttural outs from the same underworld. The riffs fast, continuous and master guitar, accompanied by a brutal drums and bass, which looks like a guitar that give you power.\n\nSince then the group presentation can not be better, do not let us catch air in no time, with tracks like &quot;Flesh consumed&quot;, &quot;Crimson surise&quot; visceral &quot;Devout of flesh&quot; or putting an end to the album &quot;Grotesque conception&quot;.\n\nI know that in 2011 the band released a promotional CD with two tracks that are now included in this album, &quot;Crimson sunrise&quot; and &quot;Devout of flesh.&quot; And I've read some criticism about the web, speaking well of the group to be your cover letter. Of course these guys are worth a lot.\n\nHonestly they will recommend to everyone this album, it's one of those things you can not miss, and of course if it is possible to see them live I'll ... something I hope not complicated because they are not far away ... are Almeria ... yes, yes, here in Spain quality music is made of high quality.\n\n1 - The Stench of Carnage (00:40)\n2 - Flesh Consumed (03:41)\n3 - Crimson Sunrise (04:34)\n4 - Famelic Lust (03:05)\n5 - Devout of Flesh (03:36)\n6 - The Scourge of Pests (03:35)\n7 - Necrotic Reborn (03:31)\n8 - Rotten Stale (04:43)\n9 - Putrid Essence (03:26)\n10 - Grotesque Conception (04:53)\n\nEnjoy!\n\nGenre:\tDeath\nSubgenre:\tBrutal Death\nBitrate:\tVbr\nSize:\t72.90 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n11 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee64001ff734f09dd4143bad12b282695aad16c3","amp;dn":"Lapidated+-+The+Stench+Of+Carnage+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee64001ff734f09dd4143bad12b282695aad16c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,100,0,31,247,52,240,157,212,20,59,173,18,178,130,105,90,173,22,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
