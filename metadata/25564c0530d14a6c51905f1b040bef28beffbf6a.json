On Seeds We Sow, Lindsey Buckingham has created some of his most personal and intimate lyrics and songs of his storied and award winning career. From the soft melodic pop/rock tinge of End of Time, the album's most rockin' track, One Take, and the almost lullaby-esque hushed tones of the closing number, She Smiles Sweetly, the album showcases Buckingham's full arsenal of skills.\n\n- - -\n\nLindsey Buckingham - Seeds We Sow  2011 \n(Buckingham Records)\n\n 1.
