Geneive Abdo, author of Mecca and Main Street, says that since 9/11, a majority of U.S. Muslims report feeling targeted by the government and ordinary citizens for suspicion of terrorism.  \nA recent Pew Forum poll, the first to measure American Muslim attitudes, found that although the majority found no conflict between living a devout Muslim life and being an American, young Muslims were almost twice as likely as their parents to attend mosque and identify themselves as Muslim first and Americans second.  They are also more outwardly religious, more likely to wear Muslim dress and more pious than older Muslims.  Perhaps most unsettling was that 26 percent felt that terrorist suicide bombings can sometimes be justified.  \n\nAbdo found some Muslims are rejecting many aspects of American society that they consider to be immoral and degrading.  Rehan Seyam is one such young Muslim who feels that her commitment to Islam, her adoption of the hijab head scarf and living in a materialistic American society is her own ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½jihad.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½  \nAcross the Atlantic Ocean in one of the most permissive societies in Europe, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who was raised as a conservative Muslim, has become a target of a more violent form of jihad.  A former member of the Dutch Parliament and now an atheist, Ali collaborated with artist Theo van Gogh on a film critical of IslamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s treatment of women.  As a result, Van Gogh was murdered by a Muslim extremist, and Ali remains a target.    \nIn London, Amanpour speaks with Ed Husain, a young Muslim who describes himself as having been radicalized as a youth to accept an extremist Islamist ideology that seeks to return peace to the world through a restoration of a governing caliphate -- an ideology he now rejects.  Similarly radicalized British Muslims are responsible for the July 7, 2005, terrorist bombings of the London Underground subway system, the recent terrorist attack on the Glasgow Airport in Scotland and the attempted car bombings in London.  \n\nGodÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Muslim Warriors was filmed in the United Kingdom, Egypt, Iran, the West Bank, the Netherlands and the United States.\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: CNN Presents-(God\\&amp;#039;s Muslim Warriors).avi\nFilesize.....: 820 MB (or 840,298 KB or 860,466,150 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:40:37 (180,938 fr)\nVideo Codec..: DivX 5.0\nVideo Bitrate: 1005 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID\\&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 632x468 (1.35:1) [~27:20]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa70145be65c0e10862c2e056c7a628e5288a11f","amp;dn":"CNN+-+God%5C%27s+Warriors+-+Part+2+-+God%5C%27s+Muslim+Warriors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa70145be65c0e10862c2e056c7a628e5288a11f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,112,20,91,230,92,14,16,134,44,46,5,108,122,98,142,82,136,161,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
