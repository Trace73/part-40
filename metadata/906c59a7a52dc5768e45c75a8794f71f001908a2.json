Normally I would never seed a DTB record, but given that this had a limited run I figured I'd make an exception. If you can find a copy, please go out an buy it. Regardless, go out an buy any/all of the Derek Trucks Band's other recordings. Support the artists that allow free taping and trading of their music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906c59a7a52dc5768e45c75a8794f71f001908a2","amp;dn":"Derek+Trucks+Band+-+Already+Live+EP+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906c59a7a52dc5768e45c75a8794f71f001908a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,108,89,167,165,45,197,118,142,69,199,90,135,148,247,31,0,25,8,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
