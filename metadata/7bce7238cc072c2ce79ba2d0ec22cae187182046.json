The central character b-rad was so over the top and yet it worked. there have been many films before about white boys trying to act like the stereotype black gang banger rapper but they have mostly flopped until now. Anthony Anderson delivers yet another funny performance. this guy is consistently funny in whatever film he appears in and i think he will go on to become a big star. regina hall as shondra is super sexy without ever having to confirm to the typical hip hop cuties we see in rap videos. kal pen also pops up in the film as a crazy arab American student. ryan oneil also features as b-rads father and i was shocked at how this normally serious dude takes to the comedy. watch this film. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bce7238cc072c2ce79ba2d0ec22cae187182046","amp;dn":"Malibu%5C%27s+Most+Wanted+%282003%29+ZenitZenZen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bce7238cc072c2ce79ba2d0ec22cae187182046","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,206,114,56,204,7,44,44,231,155,162,208,236,34,202,225,135,24,32,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
