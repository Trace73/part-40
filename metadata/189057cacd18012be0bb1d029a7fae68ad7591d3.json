But which one? And how?\r\n\r\nOver the past fifty years, more than three hundred infectious diseases have either newly emerged or reemerged, appearing in territories where theyâ€™ve never been seen before. Ninety percent of epidemiologists expect that one of them will cause a deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. It could be Ebola, avian flu, a drug-resistant superbug, or something completely new. While we canâ€™t know which pathogen will cause the next pandemic, by unraveling the story of how pathogens have caused pandemics in the past, we can make predictions about the future. In Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, the prizewinning journalist Sonia Shahâ€•whose book on malaria, The Fever, was called a â€œtour-de-force historyâ€ (The New York Times) and â€œrevelatoryâ€ (The New Republic)â€•interweaves history, original reportage, and personal narrative to explore the origins of contagions, drawing parallels between cholera, one of historyâ€™s most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens, and the new diseases that stalk humankind today.\r\n\r\nTo reveal how a new pandemic might develop, Sonia Shah tracks each stage of choleraâ€™s dramatic journey, from its emergence in the South Asian hinterlands as a harmless microbe to its rapid dispersal across the nineteenth-century world, all the way to its latest beachhead in Haiti. Along the way she reports on the pathogens now following in choleraâ€™s footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers coming out of Chinaâ€™s wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast.\r\n\r\nBy delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the worldâ€™s deadliest diseases, Pandemic reveals what the next global contagion might look likeâ€• and what we can do to prevent it.\r\n\r\nPublisher: Sarah Crichton Books (February 16, 2016)\r\nLanguage: English\r\nISBN-10: 0374122881\r\nISBN-13: 978-0374122881","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:189057cacd18012be0bb1d029a7fae68ad7591d3","amp;dn":"Pandemic%3A+Tracking+Contagions%2C+from+Cholera+to+Ebola+and+Beyond+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"189057cacd18012be0bb1d029a7fae68ad7591d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,144,87,202,205,24,1,43,224,187,29,2,154,127,174,104,173,117,145,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
