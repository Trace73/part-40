The bank&amp;#039;s henchman is the murderous Jackson. He runs afoul of two women, MarÃƒÂ­a, the tough but uneducated daughter of a farmer, and Sara, the European-educated daughter of the owner of one of these banks. To feed the now landless people and to seek revenge, MarÃƒÂ­a and Sara become bank robbers, veritable Robin Hoods. But Jackson and his hired guns are after them. What are the women&amp;#039;s options?\n\nAudio English DD 5.1 &amp; Dts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10b0323bec4452bc6f03087468a98cee4f0710f","amp;dn":"Bandidas+Nordic+Pal+Dvd+9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10b0323bec4452bc6f03087468a98cee4f0710f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,11,3,35,190,196,69,43,198,240,48,135,70,138,152,206,228,240,113,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
