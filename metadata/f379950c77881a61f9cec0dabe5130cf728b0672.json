He produced many \nfilms and television series. It was through this film-making that Dan learned how to record wildlife sound. He \npioneered techniques of recording, and also helped design equipment to optimize results, including the &quot;Dan Gibson \nParabolic Microphone&quot;. \n\nSome of his early recordings of the 1950s and 1960s were released on LP Records, and start his Solitudes series, which \nwas introduced in 1981. In 1994, Dan was awarded The Order of Canada for his environmental works. \n\n\nFrom http://www.solitudes.com/detail.aspx?ID=145\nListen to the Loons is an album devoted to the appreciation of the loon and to its preservation. It is a story, told \nthrough nature sounds alone, of this most fascinating bird and its environment.\n\n\n- - - - - - -\nPostnote: Found this torrent (too late) when searching - 157 of Dan Gibson / Solitudes albums. Like, Wow.\nProbably recommend using that one... but it's not on TPB, so maybe I'll copy it over here...\nOnly difference is this one is 320kbps (vs 192). I ripped it myself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f379950c77881a61f9cec0dabe5130cf728b0672","amp;dn":"Solitudes%3A+LISTEN+TO+THE+LOONS+%28Volume+12%29+Dan+Gibson+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f379950c77881a61f9cec0dabe5130cf728b0672","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,121,149,12,119,136,26,97,249,206,192,218,190,81,48,207,114,139,6,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
