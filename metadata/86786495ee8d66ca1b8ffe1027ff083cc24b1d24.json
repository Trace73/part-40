This may be difficult for food producers because their knowledge is essentially orientated to the performance of the final products (the packaged food). However, the assessment of the suitability of food packaging materials has to be legally demonstrated by food producers in the European Union. The first objective of this book is to provide comprehensive information about quality control (QC) in the food industry. Different viewpoints are discussed in relation to food producers, packaging producers and technical experts, including regulatory aspects. One of the most important ideas, is understanding QC failures of the 'food product' (food/packaging). The second objective is to provide proposals for new testing methods. A list of 'performance-orientated' guidelines is given for the regulatory obligations in the European Union for the technological suitability of food packaging materials. Food sectors are mentioned in relation to products, related packaging materials, known failures and existing QC procedures. This volume is a practical guide on food packaging and QC methods for food producers, packaging producers, official safety inspectors, public health institutions, certification bodies, students and researchers from academia and industry","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86786495ee8d66ca1b8ffe1027ff083cc24b1d24","amp;dn":"Food+Industry+and+Packaging+Materials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86786495ee8d66ca1b8ffe1027ff083cc24b1d24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,120,100,149,238,141,102,202,27,143,254,16,39,255,8,60,194,75,29,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
