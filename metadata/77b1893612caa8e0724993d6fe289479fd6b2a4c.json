As indicated on such tracks as &quot;Looking for a Song&quot; and &quot;Harrow Road,&quot; carrying on seemed to have become something of a burden for Jones, who increasingly turned to '60s-derived guitar riffs and simple pop melodies. The rhythm section remained too far down in the mix to induce dancing, and the tape inserts -- well, Jones was still no Pink Floyd. Obviously, by whatever name they chose, Big Audio needed to rethink their approach.
