This rebroadcast is one of many I have recorded from internet radio. A few are incomplete but most are not and I hope you enjoy these as much as I do.\n\nIn this first broadcast of 1981 broadcast:\n\nJohn Lennon died a tragic death just thirty-two days before this broadcast. His song, &quot;Starting Over&quot; went to number one shortly after and remains at number one this week in 1981.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;In the rock era, what song has zigged and zagged the most in its time on the chart?&quot;\n\nCasey tells of the band that Ed Sullivan paid $10,000 NOT to appear on his show.\n\nCasey answers the question, &quot;Which day of the week has been mentioned in the most top 40 song titles.&quot;\n\nOne singer in the countdown says she won't listen to any music by Diana Ross or Barbra Streisand. Casey explains why.\n\n1980#3: Do That To Me One More Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Captain And Tennille\n1980#2: Another Brick In The Wall Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pink Floyd\n1980#1: Call Me - Blondie\n40:    Heartbreak Hotel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Jacksons\n39:    He CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Love You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Michael Stanley Band\n38:    KillinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Fred Knoblock And Susan Anton        \n37:    Cold Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Donna Summer     \n36:    Never Be The Same Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Christopher Cross     \n35:    Seven Bridges Road Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Eagles    \n34:    Keep On Loving You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Reo Speedwagon\n33:    Whip It - Devo\n32:    I Believe In You Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Don Williams\nArchives: Surf City Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jan &amp; Dean\n31:    Same Old Lang Syne Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dan Fogelberg\n30:    The Winner Takes It All - Abba\n29:    YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Lost That LovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Feeling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates    \n28:    Woman In Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barbra Streisand\n27:    Together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Tierra\n26:    9 To 5 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dolly Parton\n25:    Miss Sun Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Boz Scaggs\n24:    One Step Closer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Doobie Brothers\nLDD: Still Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Commodores\n23:    EverybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Got To Learn Sometime Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Korgis\nArchives: So Much In Love - The Times\n22:    Giving It Up For Your Love Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Delbert McClinton\n21:    Suddenly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Olivia Newton-John &amp; Cliff Richard\n20:    Another One Bites The Dust - Queen\n19:    Time Is Time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Andy Gibb\n18:    Master Blaster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Wonder\n17:    Hey Nineteen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Steely Dan\n16:    Celebration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kool &amp; The Gang\n15:    I Love A Rainy Night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Eddie Rabbitt\nArchives: Fingertips Part Ii Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Stevie Wonder\n14:    I Made It Through The Rain Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barry Manilow\n13:    ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Turn Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Diana Ross\n12:    Hit Me With Your Best Shot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pat Benetar\n11:    De Do Do Do De Da Da Da Da Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Police\n10:    More Than I Can Say Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Leo Sayer\n9/LDD:    Lady Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Kenny Rogers\n8:    Tell It Like It Is - Heart\n7:    Passion Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rod Stewart\n6:    Every Woman In The World Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Air Supply\n5:    Hungry Heart Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bruce Springsteen\n4:    The Tide Is High - Blondie\n3:    Guilty Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Barbra Streisand &amp; Barry Gibb\n2:    Love On The Rocks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Neil Diamond\n1:    Starting Over Ã¢â‚¬â€œ John Lennon\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18fec84513fe3fa14de4a5571d3ad87bbbcf0328","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1981_January_10th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18fec84513fe3fa14de4a5571d3ad87bbbcf0328","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,254,200,69,19,254,63,161,77,228,165,87,29,58,216,123,187,207,3,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
