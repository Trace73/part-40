In a conscious attempt to refresh their formula, DJs Zegon and particularly Apollo Nove (who is also listed as co-producer) are brought in to add an electronic character to several of the tracks. Nevertheless, the real trump card of the album is Lee 's dusting off of the pastiche humor characteristic of her work with Os Mutantes . This becomes evident on the second half of the record, with the inclusion of as many as four examples of linguistic contamination, reminiscent of songs like &quot;El Justiciero,&quot; that surprisingly provide many of Reza 's most entertaining moments. The English-sung &quot;Paradise Brasil&quot; piles up all the clichÃ©s about Brazil into a track that foreign audiences, unaware of the intrinsic irony, could easily mistake for a fabulous Bebel Gilberto dance number. In &quot;Tutti Fuditti&quot; Lee pays tribute to Rita Pavone with a '60s Italian twist meeting electronica, using familiar Italian words and expressions without worrying much about making any sense. Even more absurdist is &quot;BagdÃ¡,&quot; which does not even bother to use real words, as Lee sings in something that is vaguely Arabic-sounding and peppers it with Brazilian words that rhyme, over a faux Oriental arrangement. Lastly, &quot;Bamboogiewoogie&quot; is a seven-and-a-half-minute jam that alternates between Latin, Brazilian, and electronic sounds, and flows straight into the downright weird instrumental that closes the album, making its last ten minutes utterly different from what came before","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:752e8475db43a1731c4db9718e8cf588540df397","amp;dn":"Rita+Lee+-+Reza+%5BFlac%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"752e8475db43a1731c4db9718e8cf588540df397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,46,132,117,219,67,161,115,28,77,185,113,142,140,245,136,84,13,243,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
