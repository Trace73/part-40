How can you get a leg up Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ and win?\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Win-winÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ negotiation is an appealing idea on an intellectual level: Find the best way to convince the other side to accept a mutually beneficial outcome, and then everyone gets their fair share. The reality, though, is that people want more than their fair share; they want to win. Tell your boss that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve concocted a deal that gets your company a piece of the pie, and the reaction is likely to be: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maybe we need to find someone harder-nosed than you who knows how to win. We want the whole pie, not just a slice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ However, to return to an earlier era before Ã¢â‚¬Å“win-winÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ negotiation was in fashion and seek simply to dominate or bully opponents into submission would be a step in the wrong directionÃ¢â‚¬â€and a public relations disaster.\n\n By showing how to win at win-win negotiating, Lawrence Susskind provides the operational advice you need to satisfy the interests of your back tableÃ¢â‚¬â€the people to whom you report. He also shows you how to deal with irrational people, whose vocabulary seems limited to Ã¢â‚¬Å“no,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or with the proverbial 900-pound gorilla. He explains how to find trades that create much more value than either you or your opponent thought possible. His brilliant concept of Ã¢â‚¬Å“the trading zoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€the space where you can create deals that are Ã¢â‚¬Å“good for them but great for you,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ while still maintaining trust and keeping relationships intactÃ¢â‚¬â€is a fresh way to re-think your approach to negotiating. The outcome is often the best of both possible worlds: You claim a disproportionate share of the value youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created while your opponents still look good to the people to whom they report.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf9258ab77d1a35fb21a4c9cfcbd075600fd47c0","amp;dn":"Good+for+You%2C+Great+for+Me%3A+Finding+the+Trading+Zone+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf9258ab77d1a35fb21a4c9cfcbd075600fd47c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,146,88,171,119,209,163,95,178,26,76,156,252,189,7,86,0,253,71,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
