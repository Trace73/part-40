Starting as a weekly in 1925, the magazine is now published 47 times annually, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on the cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York. It is well known for its illustrated and often topical covers, its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\n\n\n\nIf you can afford,please visit \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:348601137dfca8e1abdda9b5a9899d893f184cd7","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+-+02+April+2012+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"348601137dfca8e1abdda9b5a9899d893f184cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,134,1,19,125,252,168,225,171,221,169,181,169,137,157,137,63,24,76,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
