It was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and professional songwriting collaborator Desmond Child. It was released in 1988 as the second single from the band&amp;#039;s massively successful 1987 album Permanent Vacation. It quickly climbed to #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, the second highest chart performance for any Aerosmith single.\n\nThe music video for &quot;Angel&quot; focuses primarily on a character played by Steven Tyler who is hypnotized by an intangible angel, presumably his ex-lover. There are also scenes of him playing the piano.\n\nThe other band members can be seen playing their instruments on city streets, and there is a notable guitar solo by Joe Perry on a rural highway.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbf2f347342f925a86efc1b9b87c9e922c1ff2ca","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+Angel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbf2f347342f925a86efc1b9b87c9e922c1ff2ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,242,243,71,52,47,146,90,134,239,193,185,184,124,158,146,44,31,242,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
