Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary. Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and from the mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and and beauty of the astronauts' experiences--experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time &quot;for all mankind.&quot;\n\nThe film begins with President Kennedy's September 12, 1962 speech at Rice announcing the goal of going to the moon. The rest of the film, using NASA footage and the voices of Apollo astronauts, takes us on a voyage to the moon, from the donning of space suits to splashdown. Footage of the scientists and engineers in Houston is inter-cut with footage of blastoff, orbiting the earth, looking back at a receding earth from inside the space capsule, circling the moon, seeing its surface up close, landing, and scenes of the astronauts on the moon's surface. They bring music with them, announce football scores, test a theory of Galileo's, and reflect on the wonder of the experience.\n\n\nGeneral\n\nComplete name                    : For All Mankind.1989.BRRip.720p.H264.AAC-HIS\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFile size                        : 1.09 GiB [1/4 DVD]\nDuration                         : 1h 20mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 947 Kbps\nOriginal Source                  : For.All.Mankind.1989.BluRay.720p.x264.DTS-CHD (4.37 GiB)\n\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 1 566 Kbps\nWidth                            : 960 pixels\nHeight                           : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nStream size                      : 897 MiB (80%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 384 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 530 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 216 MiB (19%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf3746779c606480ccd0c520fbad91eac9137748","amp;dn":"For+All+Mankind+1989+BRRip+720p+H264+AAC-HIS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf3746779c606480ccd0c520fbad91eac9137748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,55,70,119,156,96,100,128,204,208,197,32,251,173,145,234,201,19,119,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
