What do eBay and General Electric have in common with the abolitionist and womenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rights movements? What fundamental choice put General Motors and Toyota on vastly different paths? How could winning a Supreme Court case be the biggest mistake MGM could have made?\n\nAfter five years of groundbreaking research, Ori Brafman and Rod A. Beckstrom share some unexpected answers, gripping stories, and a tapestry of unlikely connections. The Starfish and the Spider argues that organizations fall into two categories: traditional ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œspiders,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which have a rigid hierarchy and top-down leadership, and revolutionary ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstarfish,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which rely on the power of peer relationship.\n\nThe Starfish and the Spider explores what happens when starfish take on spiders (such as the music industry vs. Napster, Kazaa, and the P2P services that followed). It reveals how established companies and institutions, from IBM and Intuit to the U.S. government, are also learning how to incorporate starfish principles to achieve success.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ddfbc9c5d10987627be901707dda121611f193b","amp;dn":"Ori+Brafman+-+The+Starfish+and+the+Spider","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ddfbc9c5d10987627be901707dda121611f193b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,223,188,156,93,16,152,118,39,190,144,23,7,221,161,33,97,31,25,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
