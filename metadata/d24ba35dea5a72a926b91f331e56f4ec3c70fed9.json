Dantec\n\nToorop, a hard-boiled leatherneck veteran, has been hired to escort a young woman from Russia to Canada. But Marie is no ordinary girl. A schizophrenic and a possible carrier of a new artificial virus, Marie is bearing  a mutant embryo created by an American cult, which dreams of producing a genetically modified messiah that will end all human life as we know it. Now, Toorop will risk his life to save Marie, as her brain, linking to the neuromatrix, surpasses all limits to become the universe itself.\n\nCombining metaphysics with cyberpunk post-humanism in the spirit of Philip K. Dick, Babylon Babies rides Nietzsche's prophecy: &quot;Man is something to be overcome.&quot;\n\n&quot;Explosive and paranoid...An intense, intellectually labyrinthine ride.&quot; -- Publishers Weekly\n\nThis novel is the basis for the movie Babylon A.D.\n\n~20 hours. 64 kbps mp3\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d24ba35dea5a72a926b91f331e56f4ec3c70fed9","amp;dn":"Babylon+Babies+-+Maurice+G.+Dantec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d24ba35dea5a72a926b91f331e56f4ec3c70fed9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,75,163,93,234,90,114,169,38,185,31,51,30,86,244,236,60,112,254,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
