Share!\n\n\n--\nBeginning as a cozy studio date where Duke Ellington was to merely commit a couple of recent compositions to tape, this session exploded into an uptempo Ellington appreciation party. The Duke's band was just returning from a Florida stint, and the ensuing, impromptu &quot;Welcome Home&quot; bash broke out at Columbia's studios in New York. Jimmy Rushing stopped in, as did Dizzy Gillespie and a couple dozen other admirers. Musically, the Ellington unit is in prime form, taking up the recent percussion-heavy &quot;Malletoba Spank&quot; and &quot;Tymperturbably Blue&quot; with polyrhythmic gusto and ripping through &quot;Ready, Go!&quot; in tight, swaggering form. Dizzy's trumpet chimes in on &quot;U.M.M.G.&quot; and &quot;Hello Little Girl,&quot; playing muted solos that fit like a hand in the band's welcoming glove. This recording has the earmarks of a party, per its title, and the shindig was hopping. --Andrew Bartlett\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90683851359ee9a44c3bd7637bf2483b8867ba00","amp;dn":"Duke+Ellington+-+Jazz+Party+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90683851359ee9a44c3bd7637bf2483b8867ba00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,104,56,81,53,158,233,164,76,59,215,99,123,242,72,59,136,103,186,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
