In a series of five inspired, original debates, Taliaferro taps into several famous exchanges, including those among Antony Flew, Basil Mitchell and R. M. Hare; between Frederick Copleston and Bertrand Russell; and between Copleston and A. J. Ayer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b3a62d1129440cbd9b99f96ae9b124f5e8f2120","amp;dn":"Dialogues+about+God+%28New+Dialogues+in+Philosophy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b3a62d1129440cbd9b99f96ae9b124f5e8f2120","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,58,98,209,18,148,64,203,217,185,159,150,174,155,18,79,94,143,33,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
