However since the 2006 remastering and expansion of most of Helloween's back catalogue featuring all of the tracks here (plus much more) this box is now seen as a piece for mainly collector's.\n\n\nCD 1\n\n1. &quot;Mr. Torture&quot;   Kusch 3:28 \n2. &quot;I Can&quot;   Deris, Weikath 4:39 \n3. &quot;Power&quot;   Weikath 3:28 \n4. &quot;Where The Rain Grows&quot;   Weikath, Deris 4:46 \n5. &quot;Eagle Fly Free&quot;   Weikath 5:08 \n6. &quot;Future World&quot;   Hansen 4:02 \n7. &quot;Metal Invaders&quot;   Hansen 4:10 \n8. &quot;Murderer (Remix)&quot;   Hansen 4:33 \n9. &quot;Starlight (Remix)&quot;   Weikath, Hansen 4:13 \n10. &quot;How Many Tears&quot;   Weikath 7:15 \n11. &quot;Ride The Sky (Remix)&quot;   Hansen 6:43 \n12. &quot;Halloween&quot;   Hansen 13:18 \n13. &quot;A Little Time&quot;   Kiske 3:59 \n14. &quot;A Tale That Wasn't Right&quot;   Weikath 4:42 \n15. &quot;I Want Out&quot;   Hansen 4:41 \n\nCD 2\n\n1. &quot;Keeper Of The Seven Keys (remix)&quot;   Weikath 13:50 \n2. &quot;Dr. Stein (remix)&quot;   Weikath 5:03 \n3. &quot;The Chance&quot;   Grapow 3:46 \n4. &quot;Windmill&quot;   Weikath 5:12 \n5. &quot;Sole Survivor&quot;   Weikath, Deris 4:30 \n6. &quot;Perfect Gentleman&quot;   Weikath, Deris 3:53 \n7. &quot;In The Middle Of A Heartbeat&quot;   Weikath, Deris 4:30 \n8. &quot;Kings Will Be Kings&quot;   Weikath 5:08 \n9. &quot;Time Of The Oath&quot;   Weikath, Deris 6:56 \n10. &quot;Forever And One (Neverland)&quot;   Deris 3:50 \n11. &quot;Midnight Sun&quot;   Weikath 6:19 \n12. &quot;Mr Ego (Take Me Down)&quot;   Grapow 7:07 \n13. &quot;Immortal&quot;   Deris 4:04 \n14. &quot;Mirror Mirror&quot;   Deris 3:43 \n\nCD 3\n(Buried Treasure, bonus CD)\n\n1. &quot;Shit And Lobster&quot;   Weikath 4:10 \n2. &quot;Oriental Journey&quot;   Grapow 5:44 \n3. &quot;I Don't Care, You Don't Care&quot;   Weikath 4:00 \n4. &quot;Ain't Got Nothing Better&quot;   Grosskopf 4:39 \n5. &quot;Moshi Moshi - Shiki No Uta (live)&quot;   Kusch, Grapow 6:49 \n6. &quot;Can't Fight Your Desire&quot;   Deris 3:45 \n7. &quot;Star Invasion&quot;   Deris, Weikath 4:48 \n8. &quot;Silicon Dreams&quot;   Grosskopf 4:17 \n9. &quot;Grapowski's Malmsuite 1001 (In D Doll)&quot;   Grapow 6:33 \n10. &quot;The Hellion / Electric Eye&quot; (Judas Priest cover) Halford, Downing, Tipton 4:07 \n11. &quot;A Game We Shouldn't Play&quot;   Deris 3:38 \n\n\nAndi Deris - vocals (CD1: track 1-4, CD2: track 5-14, CD3: track 6-8, 10, 11)\nMichael Kiske - vocals (CD1: track 5-15, CD2: track 1-4, CD3: track 1, 3, 4)\nKai Hansen - guitar, background vocals (CD1: track 5-15, CD2: track 1, 2)\nMichael Weikath - guitar (CD1: all tracks, CD2: all tracks, CD3: 1-4, 6-11)\nRoland Grapow - guitar (CD1: track 1-4, CD2: track 3-14, CD3: all tracks\nMarkus Grosskopf - bass (CD1: all tracks, CD2: all tracks, CD3: 1-4, 6-11)\nUli Kusch - drums (CD1: track 1-4, CD2: track 5-14, CD3: track 5-11)\nIngo Schwichtenberg - drums (CD1: track 5-15, CD2: track 1-4, CD3: track 1-4)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Chest_(Helloween_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Chest_(Helloween_album)&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:389b40d0e9bc8de258e1e7aaeaf58589e61114eb","amp;dn":"Helloween+-+Treasure+Chest+%5B3CD%5D+%282002%29+%5BAPE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"389b40d0e9bc8de258e1e7aaeaf58589e61114eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,155,64,208,233,188,141,226,88,225,231,170,234,245,133,137,230,17,20,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
