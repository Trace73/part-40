It is also known as Tales from the Crypt, Part II. It continues it's predecessor's popular formula of using established stars in five witty short horror episodes. The first, &quot;Midnight Mass,&quot; shows that having a vampire for a relative can be upsetting, to say the least. In &quot;The Neat Job&quot; a nagging neat-freak is neatly nullified. In &quot;This Trick'll Kill You,&quot; a colonial overlord learns that it's not safe to steal magic tricks from natives. &quot;Bargain in Death&quot; exposes the greed of two insurance swindlers, and &quot;Drawn and Quartered&quot; takes &quot;The Picture of Dorian Grey&quot; one better. Among the stars appearing in these episodes are Terry-Thomas, Glynnis Johns, Curt Jurgens, Denholm Elliott and Tom Baker. \n\nFeatures:\nMidnight Mess\nThe Neat Job\nThis Trick'll Kill Ya\nBargain In Death\nDrawn and Quartered\n\nRipped from the original 1981 video tape!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cf04c4a2406fc81aae3611d923dbd05b8919452","amp;dn":"The.Vault.Of.Horror.XivD.video.tape.rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cf04c4a2406fc81aae3611d923dbd05b8919452","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,240,76,74,36,6,252,129,170,227,97,29,146,61,189,5,184,145,148,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
