Aubin shows how to create compelling architectural designs using the modeling tools in Revit. This course covers the entire building information modeling (BIM) workflow, from design concept to publishing. It also covers navigating the Revit interface, modeling basic building features such as walls, doors and windows, working with sketch-based components such as roofs and stairs, annotating designs with dimensions and callouts, and adding 3D geometry. Exercise files are included with the course.\nTopics include:\n\n    Introducing building information modeling (BIM)\n    Adding levels, grids, and columns to set up a project\n    Creating building layouts with walls, doors and windows\n    Modifying wall types and properties\n    Working with DWG files and CAD inserts\n    Adding rooms\n    Adding filled and masking regions and detailing\n    Generate schedules and reports\n    Understanding families\n    Using reference planes, parameters and constraints\n    Outputting files, including DWF and PDF files\n\n\nTO USE .iso FILES DOWNLOAD THIS;    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/search/Power%20iso%20%5Bthethingy%5D/0/99/300&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ede7909ea012f5a106906ab9253a9f55d60461d5","amp;dn":"REVIT+ARCHITECTURE+2011+ESSENTIAL+TRAINING+%5Bthethingy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ede7909ea012f5a106906ab9253a9f55d60461d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,231,144,158,160,18,245,161,6,144,106,185,37,58,159,85,214,4,97,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
