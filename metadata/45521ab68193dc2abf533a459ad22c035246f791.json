ThreadX has been deployed in approximately 500 million devices worldwide. General concepts and terminology are detailed along with problem solving of common pitfalls and problems. The features and services of ThreadX are reviewed. The references to a specific processor have been removed to allow for the book to be technology agnostic and applicable to all types of microprocessors that the reader may be working with. Two e-book supplements will be available with registration of your book at www.newnespress.com, the first on ARM processors and the second, ColdFire processors.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThreadX is the Operating System used in Apple's A4 devices baseband (iphone4 3,1 3,2)\r\nSo if you are into iphone baseband hacking and sim unlocks, this book is a good resource.\r\n\r\nPS: if you find a hack for iPhone 4 BB 04.12.9 let me Know :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45521ab68193dc2abf533a459ad22c035246f791","amp;dn":"Real-Time+Embedded+Multithreading+Using+ThreadX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45521ab68193dc2abf533a459ad22c035246f791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,82,26,182,129,147,220,42,191,83,58,69,154,210,44,3,82,70,247,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
