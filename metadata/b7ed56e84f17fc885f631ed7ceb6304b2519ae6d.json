Harris, who had led the popular Three Sounds in the 1960s, had been living in obscurity in Boise, ID, for several years before he was urged by bassist Ray Brown to come to the West Coast for some recording sessions. Harris became a permanent member of Brown&amp;#039;s regular trio for quite a few years before launching his own quartet. He had lost none of his technique, soul, or swing in the interim, as he shows throughout this fine release. Seven of the eight numbers (highlighted by &quot;Exactly Like You,&quot; &quot;Teach Me Tonight,&quot; and &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;) feature Brown, Harris, and drummer Gerryck King playing soulful bop, while &quot;Mistreated But Undefeated Blues&quot; adds guitarist Emily Remler and the tenor of Red Holloway. An excellent effort.  - All Music Guide\n\nOne of my favourite.
