I decided to scale that down to perfect DVD RES.\nIt is a fan edit of sorts and then again not. I did not cut or add any scene. Instead I changed the subs to what they actually said and meant. The original sub was very typical while the actual dialogue was more menacing.\nThen I reshuffled 4 main scenes.\n1. In the intro I've put in the CGI end title of the movie with the movie's theme.\n2. I've put the IRONMAN title at the very end when Tony says &quot;I am Ironman&quot;\n3. I've moved the Nick Fury scene ahead to right after the title leaves.\n4. I've moved the &quot;I am Iron-man&quot; Black Sabbath song into the end title scene.\n\nThe reasons for this edit were... \nNow you don't have to fast forward or sit through the end credit to goto the Nick fury scene.\nYou dont have to wait through the CGI outro to see the Nick Fury scene.\nYou don't have to miss out on the cool CGI outro scene either.\nWe get a more 'proper' Intro to the movie like Superman, Spider-man and X-men do.\nProper subs that convery the actual meaning and the feelings.\n\nSorry I didn't make the audio 5.1... haven't learned how to encode tht yet. The size is standard 4.34 gig. Meaning you can fit this in a normal blank DVD-R/+R.\n\nAll in all this does not take anything away from the movie but With these small reshuffling I think it adds more to the movie.\nYou be the judge and as always...\n\nENJOY!!!\n\nBy the way, in the monitor the picture might not look perfect but I checked it out on my 32&quot; 100 hrz CRT TV and the 50&quot; Full HD plasma and it looks perfectly fine.\nYou be the judge.\n\nP.S. - There's also a DVDRES version of this available for the ones who want that. That source for the DVDres one is Blu-ray as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c541c46c6a3a6b523cd78f15dc97b596746992de","amp;dn":"Ironman+2008+BDRIP+720p+BAPMAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c541c46c6a3a6b523cd78f15dc97b596746992de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,65,196,108,106,58,107,82,60,215,143,21,220,151,181,150,116,105,146,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
