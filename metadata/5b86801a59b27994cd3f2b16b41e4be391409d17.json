rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kungfucinema.com/reviews/soul-of-the-sword-1978&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSoul of the Sword was an interesting film that revolves around the aspirations of a young Swordsman.\n\nThe film starts when a young swordsman challeges the emperors lead instructor,the King of Swords to a duel. His hope is to defeat the King of Swords so he can take the title for himself. However, he makes a calculated error when doing so. He brings the woman he loves along with him and loses the duel.\n As a result, he is killed and his lover also commits suicide once the duel is over. It is thought that he lost mainly because he was distracted by his woman during the duel, which broke his concentration.\n\nAs the duel was occuring however, a young boy happens to watch the whole thing. He decides that he will grow up one day to challenge and defeat the King of Swords himself so he can claim the title.\n Ten plus years go by and he becomes an adult with suberb sword skills. Then he goes around as the nameless swordsman, creating a reputation for himself as he defeats other well known swordsmen.\n At the same time he is haunted by the image of the young woman who committed suicide after the duel. He shrugs it off at first until he meets a young lady who looks exaclty like the woman that has been haunting him. He eventually falls for her, but continues to make plans to fight the King of Swords.\n However, he obtains a friend that warns him that his duel will not go well if he continues to have a hinderance in his life, like the young man did from several years before. The nameless swordsman eventually understands that his new found love will become his distraction as well, so he takes matters to correct it.\n\nEventually he comes to the duel with the King of Swords, but things don't turn out the way he expected, and he soon regrets some of the decissions he made to get to that point.\n I don't want to spoil the film for you so I'll leave the rest for you to see on your own.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Ynmryr2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Ynmryr2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is personally brought to you by the Carjacker, from The Chop Shop.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
