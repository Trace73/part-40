Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness.\n\nBloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1bd126f842eaa456a5b9c54820e626a4aa7c00d","amp;dn":"Timothy+Snyder+-+Bloodlands","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1bd126f842eaa456a5b9c54820e626a4aa7c00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,189,18,111,132,46,170,69,106,91,156,84,130,14,98,106,74,167,192,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
