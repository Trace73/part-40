Thus, with the power cosmic in his grasp, he is transformed into the Silver Surfer! But how much of his humanity remains?\n\nAfter the extremely well-received Galactus arc in the pages of the Fantastic Four, fan demand and economic prospects conspired to create this first run of the Silver Surfer, which lasted only 18 issues before sales waned and the title was cancelled. However, Stan Lee himself has said many times that this is his favorite character that he created and that these pages contain some of his finest writing - and he's probably right on that score. Aided with the wonderful art of both John Buscema and Jack &quot;The King&quot; Kirby, this is an all-time classic run.\n\nAll issues are presented in digital editions, thanks to milton19-Empire. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:971fcdba7c245452701129d69095dc3d2ca516a4","amp;dn":"The+Silver+Surfer+v1+01-18+%281968-1970%7CDigital%7Cmilton19-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"971fcdba7c245452701129d69095dc3d2ca516a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,31,205,186,124,36,84,82,112,17,41,214,144,149,220,61,44,165,22,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
