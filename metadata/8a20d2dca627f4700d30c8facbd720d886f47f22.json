Strange Embrace is very...strange. In fact it's just about as complex, compelling, and generally fucked-up as the Twentieth century which its protagonist Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Anthony Corbeau Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seems to represent.\n\nIn part psychological horror, in part an existentialist study of the classic &quot;Outsider&quot;, this &quot;graphic novel&quot;, unlike most of them, really does warrant the term 'novel'. It has the emotional, thematic and historic sweep of a novel, but manages to retain the immediacy and cerebral impact of the best comic.\n\nThe narrative is intricate, shifting sometimes breathlessly between place, time and character: we are led into the story by little Sukumar, a product of late twentieth century multi-cultural Britain, into the past, into the strange, and into horror. And it is at times real horror.\n\nPrepare to be shocked.\n\nStrange Embrace is dark.\n\nAnd very strange.\n\n- Peter Milligan ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a20d2dca627f4700d30c8facbd720d886f47f22","amp;dn":"Strange+Embrace","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a20d2dca627f4700d30c8facbd720d886f47f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,32,210,220,166,39,244,112,13,48,200,250,203,215,32,216,134,244,127,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
