He is then shown around the school by Michael, who \nwill become his best friend. During his tour is when Cameron first sees Bianca Stratford, \na beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date. And neither is her \n&quot;shrew&quot; sister, Katarina, a senior who loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates \nconformity. But Kat and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... \nas long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find \nsomeone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey \nDonner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays \nsomeone to take out Kat... \n\n\n  01.
