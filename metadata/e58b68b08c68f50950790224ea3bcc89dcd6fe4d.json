A homegrown mom-and-pop operation, Duck Commander has become a sporting empire by fabricating top-of-the-line duck calls and decoys out of salvaged swamp wood.\n\nThis newly minted multimillionaire family is kept in line by business-savvy Willie, who runs Duck Commander with the help of his brother Jase, their respective wives Korie and Missy, patriarch and founder of the company, Phil, and uncle Si. Together they run a booming business that employs half their neighborhood, but at the end of the day, you can find the whole family around matriarch Miss Kay's dinner table.\n\nEach episode brings a new set of challenges, met with a special brand of Southern know-how and a down-home sense of humor.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e58b68b08c68f50950790224ea3bcc89dcd6fe4d","amp;dn":"Duck.Dynasty.S04E07.HDTV.x264-KILLERS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e58b68b08c68f50950790224ea3bcc89dcd6fe4d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,139,104,176,140,104,245,9,80,121,2,36,234,59,204,137,220,214,254,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
