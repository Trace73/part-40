This created a stalemate in the world similar to the Cold War of the '80s. The Allies now have Generation 1 technology and the Axis were at Generation 3 technology.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:492682aefac4dd7e5170c6e7b419184ca43795a2","amp;dn":"Paolo+Parente%27s+Dust+01+of+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"492682aefac4dd7e5170c6e7b419184ca43795a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,38,130,174,250,196,221,126,81,112,198,231,180,25,24,76,164,55,149,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
