ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a lot to ask. But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s before heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given some bad news: heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sick and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to die. Which totally sucks. Hope arrives in the winged form of Dulcie, a loopy punk angel/possible hallucination with a bad sugar habit. She tells Cam there is a cureÃ¢â‚¬â€if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to go in search of it. With the help of a death-obsessed, video-gaming dwarf and a yard gnome, Cam sets off on the mother of all road trips through a twisted America into the heart of what matters most.\n\nThanks to jessicado22 for uploading this book to theaudiobookbay.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b029c4592c2e40715acb1bb7b211e24c4f3f420f","amp;dn":"Libba+Bray+-+Going+Bovine+-+%28audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b029c4592c2e40715acb1bb7b211e24c4f3f420f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,41,196,89,44,46,64,113,90,203,27,183,178,17,226,76,79,63,66,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
