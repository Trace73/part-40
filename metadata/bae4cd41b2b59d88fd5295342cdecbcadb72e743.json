The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album 'The Perpetual Paradox' was mastered by Mick Kenney (Anaal Nathrakh) and recorded in two split sessions; the first, in July Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ09 and the second, in September Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ09 at Hellfire Studios in Birmingham (previously done work for Motorhead, Immortal and Orange Goblin). It was released through the Midlands based label Dissected Records and received highly enthusiastic reviews throughout the underground music scene.\n\nAlthough the band has played live extensively in support of the debut album it seems as though appearances on the live circuit have now become rare.
