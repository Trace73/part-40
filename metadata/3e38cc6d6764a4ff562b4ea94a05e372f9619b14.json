WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be easier just to pass the clean funding bill? Of course it wouldÃ¢â‚¬â€thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just another reason that Republicans refuse to do it. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about negotiatingÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about doing the basics of your job. And you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need a super committee to tell you to do that.\n\nBernie Sanders is also pointing out that this government shutdown has been planned since the moment that President Obama was reelected. They didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a very good plan for winning the election, so instead they came up with a plan to nullify the results of the election.\n\nCongressman Ted Yoho says that defaulting on the national debt would be a great thing for everybody. But if that were true... then Republicans would never want to do it. Asked about defaulting on the debt, Ted Yoho said Ã¢â‚¬Å“I think, personally, it would bring stability to the world markets.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Well when you get down to it, things ARE awfully stable after a collapse. Ted Yoho is a Congressman from Florida. Down here weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re used to voting for a whole bunch of yohos.\n\nMichele Bachmann says President Obama is sending arms to Al Qaeda, which she says proves we are living in the End Times. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know about that but I do know that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s doing everything she can to bring them on.\n\nIf Washington isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shut down enough for your tastes, a bunch of rightwing truckers are planning on intentionally clogging the DC beltway... as though anybody had to go out of their way to cause a traffic jam on the DC beltway. The group has a bizarre list of far rightwing demands, including support for the crazy gun lunatic police chief who got fired in Pennsylvania. Yeesh. What happened to the good old days when all that a trucker wanted was ass, gas, or grass? So theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got a list of impossible demands and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re willing to shut the country down to get their way. The only difference between them and the Republican Party is the trucker hats.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e38cc6d6764a4ff562b4ea94a05e372f9619b14","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+October+08+2013","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e38cc6d6764a4ff562b4ea94a05e372f9619b14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,56,204,109,103,100,164,255,86,43,78,169,74,5,227,114,249,97,155,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
