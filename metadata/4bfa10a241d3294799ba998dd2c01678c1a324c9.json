This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nMany of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser)  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nWARNING: \n\nIf you limit your upload speed during the download FOR WHATEVER REASON, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be kicked-out for good.

NO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ITÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S ABOUT SHARING. If you do not want or can or care to share, please, go someplace else. Consider this as one friendly warning. \n\n\nAlso, in the future, if I spot something like gang-banging of innocents, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll feel my response, I promise. If you are not satisfied with things IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve just said, please ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ go away. Internet is a Big place for all of us. And donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t come back. Please.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nWhat goes around comes around. Give and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be given.\n\nI am a sort of refugee from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œminimalistic-was-a-starÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Many of my friends, my ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRegularsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ came on TPB following my torrents. It takes a long time not just to make people to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrecognizeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ my small-sized stuff, but to adopt specific models of behaviour, when they interact, cooperate one with each other, exchange and, at the end, enjoy shows and movies. \n\nOne thing I have always repeated: Solidarity. We, people from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDeveloped countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ seem like have forgotten too easy what was only five-six years back when majority was on dial-up, wrestling with 2-4 kB/s. \n\nWe also forget how hard is to live far away from all cultural, sociological ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcushionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ our societies have provided for us, be surrounded with unbearable hardness of life, live surrounded by unimaginable poverty, diseases ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and a feeling of total disconnection from the rest of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œshinyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ world, where obviously, no one cares about anything else but themselves. We, who have ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmoreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ must share with the ones who have lessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Must. Other ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œtypesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of behaviour are not welcomed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ here. People who cannot share could go away, doors are open. Trespassers and punks will be escorted someplace else.\n\nWe are the rebels by nature, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why we are here on place called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPirate bayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ not to eat each otherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hearts out. We are here because world around is a dark place. People who come here are not the enemies, most of us struggle to survive, and taking just that and that much we need not to feel deprived by injustice. We are here to fight unrighteousness, but not amongst us. Never forget that.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bfa10a241d3294799ba998dd2c01678c1a324c9","amp;dn":"Psych.S04E10.HDTV.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bfa10a241d3294799ba998dd2c01678c1a324c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,250,16,162,65,211,41,71,153,186,153,141,210,192,22,120,193,163,36,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
