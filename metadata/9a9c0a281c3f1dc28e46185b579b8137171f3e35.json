Sonny runs a home for delinquent boys, and Dean was sent there for stealing food when he was younger. Sam is stunned he never knew this about his brother and asks for more information, but Dean dodges his questions. Another murder occurs while Sam and Dean are at the house, so they scramble to find the culprit before anyone else dies. Meanwhile, Dean looks up an old girlfriend and recalls his time at the house.\n\nFormat                                   : Matroska\nFormat version                           : Version 2\nFile size                                : 126 MiB\nDuration                                 : 42mn 26s\n\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.739\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a9c0a281c3f1dc28e46185b579b8137171f3e35","amp;dn":"Supernatural+S09E07+HDTV+x264+AAC+%5BVectoR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a9c0a281c3f1dc28e46185b579b8137171f3e35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,156,10,40,28,63,29,194,142,70,24,91,87,155,129,55,23,31,62,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
