It thus blends the traditional differential equations text with the best of the more recent reform approaches. Written completely from the perspective of the student, the text provides strong pedagogy along with an informal, interactive style to help students develop an effective understanding of important techniques and applications.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Worked out examples and exercises taken from biology, chemistry, economics, physics, and engineering enable students to see how math applies to their chosen majors.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Coverage of a graphing calculator and/or CAS (computer algebra system) is fully integrated into the text to help students construct the required graphs and numerical approximations.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Every chapter begins with an informal Introduction that sets the tone and prepares students for the material to come.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ A narrative Summary at the end of each chapter reminds the reader of the important concepts in the chapter.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ An appendix containing traditional coverage of series solutions is included in the back of the text.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57f6f8f9fda798dea15fdb5edb3690f46578ce17","amp;dn":"A+Modern+Introduction+to+Differential+Equations+2009++-+%28Malestr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57f6f8f9fda798dea15fdb5edb3690f46578ce17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,246,248,249,253,167,152,222,161,95,219,94,219,54,144,244,101,120,206,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
