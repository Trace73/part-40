An inhabitant of earth. Webster&amp;#039;s Unabridged Dictionary, 1989\n\nEARTHLINGS is a feature length documentary about humanity&amp;#039;s absolute dependence on animals (for pets, food, clothing, entertainment, and scientific research) while also illustrating our complete disrespect for these so-called &quot;non-human providers.&quot; The film is narrated by Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (GLADIATOR) and features music by the critically acclaimed platinum artist Moby. With an in-depth study into pet stores, puppy mills and animals shelters, as well as factory farms, the leather and fur trades, sports and entertianment industries, and finally the medical and scientific profession itself, EARTHLINGS uses hidden cameras and never before seen footage to chronicle the day-to-day practices of some of the largest industries in the world, all of which rely entiely on animals for profit.\n\nPowerful, informative and thought-provoking, EARTHLINGS is by far the most comprehensive documentary ever produced on the correlation between nature, animals, and human economic interests. The film is actually Part Two in a trilogy of documentaries that focus on the three primary life forms that exist on planet earth: Nature, Animals and Humankind.\n\nThe aim of the film may be best summarized by author Peter Singer, who wrote in his superb book Animal Liberation: &quot;in order to lead people in making the mental switch in their attitudes and practices toward a very large group of beings: members of species other than our own.&quot;\n\nDescription is taken from the (now closed or for the moment being down) site http://www.nationearth.org.
