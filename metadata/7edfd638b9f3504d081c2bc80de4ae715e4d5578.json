This is a superb Progressive rock in the Seventies' spirit, full of contrated climates, breaks and complex compositions based on tortuous, audacious and elaborated instrumental developments. They combine strong melodies with intricate arrangements and superb musicianship. SPOCK'S BEARD should appeal to fans of the FLOWER KINGS and UK.\n\nThis adventurous band has built a solid and loyal following with their first two releases. &quot;The Light&quot; received rave reviews across the globe and &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; was by far the best progressive rock album of the decade. The next releases (&quot;The Kindness...&quot;, &quot;Day For Night&quot; &amp; &quot;V&quot;) were issued to insatiable fans world wide. &quot;Snow&quot; is SPOCK's BEARD best work, a classic CD-set that will be a treasured magnum opus for years to come. This release is a double CD concept album in the vein of GENESIS' The Lamb. This is a musical masterpiece that will appeal to many people also beyond the Progressive community. FANS of YES, ELP, GENESIS, MARILLION, PINK FLOYD and newer &quot;Neo-Prog&quot; groups like DREAM THEATER or PORCUPINE TREE will savor this lavish concept album.\n\nWith Neal MORSE's departure, &quot;Feel Euphoria&quot; marks a fresh new beginning for the band. This is a solid album full of fresh musical ideas and prove that the BEARD is here stay with great lyrics and great inspiration. One thing's for sure, The BEARD is out there and you WILL believe!\n\nTrack listing\n\nCD 1: 66:35\n1. Beware Of Darkness #6:50#\n2. Gibberish #5:10#\n3. End Of The Day #16:58#\n4.
