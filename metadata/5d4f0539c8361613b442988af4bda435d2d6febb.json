If, for whatever reason, the system calls for you to locate a BIOS, you'll have to point it to the correct BIOS which shouldn't be too difficult because in most consoles that require BIOS there is a folder entitled 'BIOS' -- If you can't figure it out from there.. You're on your own.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nSUPPORTED CONSOLES:\n\n- Arcade\n    [Emulator: MAME]\n\n- Nintendo\n    [Emulator: FCEUX]\n- Super Nintendo\n    [Emulator: ZSNESw]\n- Nintendo 64\n    [Emulator: Project64]\n- Nintendo GameCube\n    [Emulator: Dolphin]\n- Nintendo Wii\n    [Emulator: Dolphin]\n- Nintendo DS\n    [Emulator: NO$GBA]\n- Nintendo Game Boy Advance\n    [Emulator: NO$GBA]\n\n- Sega Mega Drive\n    [Emulator: Fusion]\n- Sega Genesis\n    [Emulator: Fusion]\n- Sega CD/32X\n    [Emulator: Fusion]\n- Sega Game Gear\n    [Emulator: Fusion]\n- Sega Saturn\n    [Emulator: SSF]\n- Sega Dreamcast*\n    [Emulator: nullDC]\n\n- Sony Playstation\n    [Emulator: pSX]\n- Sony Playstation 2\n    [Emulator: PCSX2]\n- Sony PSP\n    [Emulator: JPCSP]\n\n\n* = xPadder has been included with nullDC since nullDC won't map a controller.
