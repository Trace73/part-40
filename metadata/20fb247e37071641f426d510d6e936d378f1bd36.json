(Tuesday Weld was featured on Dobie Gillis which is \ncurrently being shared here in  easy to grab single episodes.)\n\n\nSummary\n\n   &quot;'Sex Kitten, American Version' Mamie van Doren joins forces with 'Sex \nKitten, junior grade' Tuesday Weld and 'Sex Kitten, French version' Mijanou \nBardot for this screwball campus comedy that prefigures both grind house flicks \nand family-friendly college capers. When Collins College digital supercomputer, \nThinko picks Dr. Mathilda West to head their science department, nobody expects \nthe polymath savant to pack more curves than a rack full of test tubes. While \nthe faculty struggles to pick their slack jaws up off the floor, a crew of \ngangsters puts the muscle on the 'bot, thanks to Thinko's knack for picking the \nponies&quot;.\n\nMy notes\n\n   The film (made available in 2013) is not elsewhere on the file shares that I \nknow of.   And the &quot;extended version&quot; contains footage that is risque but not \nwith any  anatomy you haven't seen on &quot;Game Of Thrones&quot;.  SKGtC has a Wiki and \nmore about the extended 'international' version is contained there.  Also in \nthis regard it's interesting to note that &quot;Marty&quot; Milner was a producer on the \nshow.\n\n  SKGtC may be considered camp or ripe for sarcastic remarks as dated and \n'naive' or even in questionable taste.  It is, I think, a good representative \nperiod piece of gags and humor.   \n\n  Of note is that for some reason &quot;Collins College&quot; appears more than once in \nthese films of the period.  &quot;College Confidential&quot; with Steve Allen (yes _the_ \nSteve Allen) also uses the name. \n\n  This is another in the collection of Mamie Van Doren films.  When &quot;Girls \nTown&quot; becomes available  it will appear as well.\n\n\nNotes written  May 22nd,   2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20fb247e37071641f426d510d6e936d378f1bd36","amp;dn":"Sex+Kittens+Go+To+College+Extended+International+Version+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20fb247e37071641f426d510d6e936d378f1bd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,251,36,126,55,7,22,65,244,38,213,16,214,233,54,211,120,241,189,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
