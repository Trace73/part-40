Yet those on the left have numerous fallacies of their own. Aversion to clean energy programs, basic biological research, and even life-saving vaccines come naturally to many progressives. These are positions supported by little more than junk-science and paranoid thinking.\n \nNow for the first time, science writers Dr. Alex B. Berezow and Hank Campbell have drawn open the curtain on the leftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fear of science. As Science Left Behind reveals, vague inclinations about the wholesomeness of all things natural, the unhealthiness of the unnatural, and many other seductive fallacies have led to an epidemic of misinformation. The results: public health crises, damaging and misguided policies, and worst of all, a new culture war over basic scientific facts ?in which the left is just as culpable as the right.\n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef86a9140fd5f6aa167a8eccd2872f2d619b4c2","amp;dn":"Science+Left+Behind%3A+Feel-Good+Fallacies+%282012%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef86a9140fd5f6aa167a8eccd2872f2d619b4c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,248,106,145,64,253,95,106,161,103,168,236,205,40,114,242,214,25,180,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
