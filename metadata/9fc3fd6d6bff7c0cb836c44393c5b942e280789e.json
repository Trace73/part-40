Because of Gilda's fatal fascination, Regan decides to get rid of her husband so that he himself can marry her; and he hits on an ingenious murder plan. The murderer is to be the television set that stands in the husband's lounge. But ingenious murder plans have habit of backfiring, and this one is no exception. Once again James Hadley Chase lives up to his reputation for sustained suspense, graphic and economical writing, and on the last page, a complete surprise.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n*  This is made by me from my personal collection  *\n____________________________________________________","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fc3fd6d6bff7c0cb836c44393c5b942e280789e","amp;dn":"James+Hadley+Chase+-+Shock+Treatment+-+Epub%2FMobi+-+High+Quality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fc3fd6d6bff7c0cb836c44393c5b942e280789e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,195,253,109,107,255,124,12,184,54,196,67,147,197,185,66,226,128,120,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
