OUR SERIOUSNESS SEEMS TO CREATE MORE DISEASE AND PARANOIA. INSTEAD OF FEELING LIKE VICTIMS, HOW CAN WE RESPOND THROUGH CELEBRATION?\r\n\r\nDeath is always there. You may be unaware of it, but it is always confronting you with immediacy. You cannot be certain of the next moment.\r\n...........................\r\nBhagawan,\r\nWHY IS THERE AN EGO? IT SEEMS SO ABSOLUTELY MEANINGLESS, AND NOT NECESSARY AT ALL -- NON-EXISTENT ACTUALLY. DO YOU KNOW?\r\n\r\nI do not know, because I don't have any ego.\r\nTo know it one has to have it.\r\nI have looked within myself, searched within myself; I have not found it anywhere.\r\nAnd your question is strange. You say, &quot;The ego is non-existent.&quot; Then why are you asking questions about things which don't exist? No, it is not non-existent for you, hence the question. Don't try to deceive yourself..\r\nBhagawan,\r\nCAN YOU PLEASE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE TOTAL? IS IT THE SAME AS NOT BEING SPLIT, OR IS THERE MORE TO IT?\r\n............................\r\nBhagawan,\r\nWILL THE NEW WOMAN HAVE TO SUFFER THE INDIGNITIES OF &quot;MONTHLY BLUES?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afaa1720388a9b36ebbccc89c9fd0202eecd334","amp;dn":"Osho_From+Death+to+Deatlessnes+%2326_TRB+vol7-26.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afaa1720388a9b36ebbccc89c9fd0202eecd334","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,250,161,114,3,136,169,179,110,187,204,200,156,159,208,32,46,236,211,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
