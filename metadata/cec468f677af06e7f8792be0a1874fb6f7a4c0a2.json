Read more on the news and updates page.\n\nLearn more about the CMU, where Daniel is serving time here.\n\nDaniel McGowan is an environmental and social justice activist from New York City. He was charged in federal court on counts of arson, property destruction and conspiracy, all relating to two actions in Oregon in 2001. Following his arrest, Daniel was offered two choices by the government: cooperate by informing on other people, or go to trial and potentially spend the rest of his life in prison. His only real option was to plead not guilty until he could reach a resolution of the case that permitted him to honor his principles. After many months of litigation and negotiation, Daniel was able to admit to his role in these two incidents, while not implicating or identifying any other people who might have been involved (for details, go here)....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec468f677af06e7f8792be0a1874fb6f7a4c0a2","amp;dn":"If+A+Tree+Falls+%282011%29+McGowan+-+YOU+OWE+HIM.++SUPPORT+HIM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec468f677af06e7f8792be0a1874fb6f7a4c0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,196,104,246,119,175,6,231,248,121,43,224,161,135,79,182,247,164,192,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
