During this period, European armies evolved modern ideas of army organization and military leadership, as well as modern views of campaign strategy and battle tactics. As European soldiers and colonists moved into Asia, the Middle East, and the Americas, the practice or influence of their military techniques and ideas also affected wars fought in those places. In this volume's 1000 plus entries, an award-winning author of reference works on international relations and war describes and defines important events, technologies, and individuals from this seminal period of global military history.\n\n# Hardcover: 656 pages\n# Publisher: Greenwood (July 30, 2008)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0313330468\n# ISBN-13: 978-0313330469","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe1a493a00c63e79c45f9d8553409153cdec08d","amp;dn":"Wars+of+the+Age+of+Louis+XIV%2C+1650-1715+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe1a493a00c63e79c45f9d8553409153cdec08d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,225,164,147,160,12,99,231,156,69,249,216,85,52,9,21,60,222,192,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
