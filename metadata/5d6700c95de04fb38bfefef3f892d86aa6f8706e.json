Lyrically, most of the songs deal with the ending of the marriage, notably Widow's Walk, If I Were a Weapon, and Soap and Water (&quot;slip me loose of this wedding band&quot;).\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/2975/coverbk1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img219.imageshack.us/img219/2975/coverbk1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
