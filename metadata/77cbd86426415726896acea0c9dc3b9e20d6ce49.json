This 1997 sampler CD surprisingly does not have any examples of his early work on Blue Note in the mid- to late 1940s, instead concentrating on selections from four of Quebec's seven late-period Blue Note albums, a few songs originally issued as 45s, and &quot;Born to Be Blue,&quot; which is taken from an album by guitarist Grant Green. The eight ballads are all standards and put the focus very much on Quebec, making for a fine mood album even if acquiring the full sessions (all but &quot;It Might As Well Be Spring&quot; are currently available on CD) is preferable. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Nancy (With The Laughing Face)\n02 - Born To Be Blue\n03 - The Man I Love\n04 - Lover Man\n05 - Willow Weep For Me\n06 - If I Could Be With You (One Hour Tonight)\n07 - Everything Happens To Me (long version)\n08 - Imagination\n09 - There Is No Greater Love\n\nPersonnel:\nSam Jones - bass\nJ.C.
