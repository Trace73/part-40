Outnumbered a million to one, mankindâ€™s only hope of survival is the J.U.M.P. Corps. Its mission is to fight the alien menace hive by hive and planet by planet.\r\n\r\nYou and your friends assume the role of JUMPERS, and blast your way through procedurally generated alien hives in chaotic run-and-gun 2D platforming action. Up to 4 Players band together in Local or Online Co-op to kill aliens, avoid traps, collect treasures and discover lost relics. Defeat fierce alien bosses to complete your mission and save the galaxy.\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n    Action Platforming: Engage swarms of aliens in frenetic combat.
