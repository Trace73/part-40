It was uploaded here once before but I have not seen this exact version since so I thought I would share it again.\n\nVery easy to use interface and features alot of history and trivia for most all of the games.  This emulator version includes every platform,shooter,fighting,trackball, and vector graphics game you probably ever played in the arcades or even thought of and even some you had not thought of or forgot.\n\nIt has all the classics you grew to know and love including all the versions and sequals of Pac Man,Donkey Kong,Asteroids,Dig Dug,Galaxian,Galaga,Centipede,Missle Command,Battle Zone,Street Fighter,Mortal Kombat, and lots lots more.\n\nThis version works great with X-Arcade or Slikstik or Hotrod game devices if you have them.\n\nJust mount or burn and install.\n\nThis is my first upload so let me know if you get it and if it works.\n\nSeed and enjoy! Long live retro gaming!! \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cd165c18f75047852cce3a4ecf98fdfa7864b31","amp;dn":"Mame32+Classic+Arcade+with+over+1400+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cd165c18f75047852cce3a4ecf98fdfa7864b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,209,101,193,143,117,4,120,82,204,227,164,236,249,143,223,167,134,75,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
