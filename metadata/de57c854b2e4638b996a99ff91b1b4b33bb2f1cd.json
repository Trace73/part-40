The whiskey filled, harmony rich outfit draws its roots from mountain folk traditions and the golden age of the singer songwriter.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€¹Debut album&quot;Big Dipper&quot; fueled the band's journey to find the spirit of old time, American music. Born and bred in Upstate New York, The North &amp; South Dakotas continue to share their sound with the Northeast.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de57c854b2e4638b996a99ff91b1b4b33bb2f1cd","amp;dn":"The+North+and+South+Dakotas+-+Big+Dipper+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de57c854b2e4638b996a99ff91b1b4b33bb2f1cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,87,200,84,178,228,99,139,153,106,153,255,145,177,180,179,59,178,241,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
