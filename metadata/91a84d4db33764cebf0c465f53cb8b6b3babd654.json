This CD includes a clever reggae adaptation of an old B.B. King tune retitled &quot;Singin' the Blues&quot; and a less successful cover of Hammer's &quot;U Can't Touch This&quot; called &quot;Don't Touch Crack.&quot; Chaplin also offers a take on James Bond with &quot;License to Kill,&quot; his thoughts on contemporary romance with &quot;Modern Girl&quot; and some other notions on life and love. His vocals and interaction with backup singers are engaging, while his verbal quips are often thoughtful and catchy.\n\n\nTracklist :\n\n1 General    \n 2 Obeah Business   \n 3 License To Kill    \n 4 Cry Blood    \n 5 Don't Touch Crack \n 6 Dem Mouth    \n 7 Think Twice    \n 8 Modern Girl    \n 9 Revival   \n 10 Singin the Blues \n\n\nEnjoyyyyyyy and Seed This One ............
