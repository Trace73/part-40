rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cave_of_the_Silken_Web_%281967_film%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&quot;Cave of the Silken Web&quot; is the film verision of one of the episodes from one of the great classical novels of Chinese literature, &quot;The Journey to the West&quot;. Written in the 16th century, it is a fictional account of the Buddhist monk Xuanzang's pilgrimage to India to obtain some sacred Buddhist scrolls.\n Xuanyang is presented as pure and handsome, and he goes around doing good deeds---and as such, he's always the target of various demons and villains. As far as defending himself though, he's pretty helpless, but he's accompanied by his three loyal companions, who are each powerful immortals: &quot;Pigsy&quot;, a pig-man who has a heady appetite for food, drink and women, &quot;Monkey&quot;, a magical, mischeivous, staff-fighting monkey-god, and Sandy, an honorable formal general who has been banished to the mortal world, and who uses for a weapon his &quot;monk's spade&quot;.\n\nIn this episode, the four encounter a cave-dwelling group of spider-demons who seek to gain immortality by killing the monk and eating him. The spider-demons, as luck would have it, turn out to be a bevy of absolutely gorgeous Chinese beauties when they're in their human form!\n   The demons know they can't beat the monkey when it comes to martial arts or magic, so instead they come up with various traps and tricks, which our heroes have to overcome.\n\nHong Kong-based Shaw Brothers was the biggest Chinese movie studio in the 60's and 70's (becoming world-famous for their martial arts movies), and this 1967 production has wonderful sets, costumes, cinematography, it has a fantastic score of traditional Chinese music, and some quite charming special effects.\n There are elements of traditional Peking Opera throughout, with some musical numbers and acrobatic fight choreography, and in general this movie is just really fun. It's a brightly colorful, engergetic, silly and multi-layered example of Chinese fantasy that's suitable for the whole family (although there a few somewhat risque moments that might be inappropriate for small children).\n These stories have been popular for centuries, and continue to be so today, as Jet Li recently played the &quot;Monkey&quot; character starring alongside Jackie Chan in The Forbidden Kingdom (you can see the young man in that movie watching the Shaw Brothers version of &quot;The Monkey Goes West&quot; in the opening scenes).\n This movie is highly recommended as a fun introduction to a classic piece of Chinese fantasy literature, and it also showcases a good deal of the strengths of Shaw Brother studios during their golden age. \n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Jan%202015/TheCaveOfSilkenWeb1967x264DVDripShawBrosmp4_thumbs_20150114_043502_zpsb086209b.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Jan%202015/TheCaveOfSilkenWeb1967x264DVDripShawBrosmp4_thumbs_20150114_043502_zpsb086209b.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
