They are so different - classic and bohemian, bow ties and batik, quirky and sensible. But Terence is persistent. Ã¢â‚¬Å“You are going to be somebody,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he tells her. Ã¢â‚¬Å“YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to need somebody to take care of you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Though initially as combative as their courtship, their marriage brings with it stormy passion, deep love and respect, two beloved children, and a life together over two decades. Then comes illness, and the fight to win a longer life for Terence.\n \n&quot;The Cost of Hope&quot; chronicles the extraordinary measures Amanda and Terence take to preserve not only TerenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life but also the life of their family. After his death, Bennett uses her skills as a veteran investigative reporter to determine the cost of their mission of hope. What she discovers raises important questions many people face, and vital issues about the intricacies of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s healthcare system.\n \nRich in humor, insight, and candor, &quot;The Cost of Hope&quot; is an unforgettable memoir, an inspiring personal story that sheds light on one of the most important turning points in life.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efdfd3ea3bde90b65b4dadb46ca4f26472aee670","amp;dn":"The+Cost+of+Hope+%28Amanda+Bennett%29+Retail+azw3+epub+%5BItzy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efdfd3ea3bde90b65b4dadb46ca4f26472aee670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,223,211,234,59,222,144,182,91,77,173,180,108,164,242,100,114,174,230,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
