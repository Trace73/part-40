Rival groups are searching for a document that holds a secret that could shatter the Catholic Church.\n\nWhile in Rome, American Jesuit priest Thomas Kelly is called upon to reclaim a centuries-old document stolen from the Vatican. An enigmatic letter leads him to the work of a 19th century poet, where Thomas discovers cryptic messages that might lead to the missing manuscript. His search is unexpectedly entwined with that of Italian art historian Livia Pietro, who tells him that destructive forces are threatening to expose the documentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contents. As theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re relentlessly chased through the heart of Rome by mysterious men who quickly demonstrate they would cross any line to obtain the document for themselves, it becomes clear to Livia and Thomas that the pages hold a deep, devastating, long-buried truth. Livia, though, has a secret of her own: she and her People are vampires. But all this pales in light of the Secret that Thomas and Livia discover togetherÃ¢â‚¬â€a revelation more stunning than either could have imagined.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a879efc1baa4b4a20d600afdd6a79044afb86420","amp;dn":"Sam+Cabot+-+Blood+of+the+Lamb+%28retail%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a879efc1baa4b4a20d600afdd6a79044afb86420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,121,239,193,186,164,180,162,13,96,10,253,214,167,144,68,175,184,100,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
