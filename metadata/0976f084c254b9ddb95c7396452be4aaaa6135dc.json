Indeed, Dizzy Gillespie had once claimed Mingus reminded him &quot;of a young Duke&quot;, citing their shared &quot;organizational genius.&quot;\n\nMingus was briefly a member of Ellington's band in 1953, as a substitute for bassist Wendell Marshall. Mingus's notorious temper led to his being one of the few musicians personally fired by Ellington (Bubber Miley and drummer Bobby Durham are among the others), after an on-stage fight between Mingus and Juan Tizol.\n\n\n--\nDisc One\n  1.
