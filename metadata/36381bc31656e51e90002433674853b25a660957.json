Debt, she says, is like air: something we take for granted until things go wrong. And then, while gasping for breath, we become very interested in it. She writes, &quot;These are not lectures about how to get out of debt; rather, they're about the debtor/creditor twinship in the broadest sense, from human sacrifice to pawnshops to revenge. In this light, what we owe and how we pay is a feature of all human societies, and profoundly shapes our shared values and our cultures.&quot;\n\nThis is part 2 of 5.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36381bc31656e51e90002433674853b25a660957","amp;dn":"CBC+Ideas+2008+Massey+Lectures+-+part+2+of+5+%28complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36381bc31656e51e90002433674853b25a660957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,56,27,195,22,86,229,30,144,0,36,51,103,72,83,178,90,102,9,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
