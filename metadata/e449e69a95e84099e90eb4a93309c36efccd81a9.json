If for some reason the download fails please write in the comments as this is my first attempt at making a torrent, I felt it was only right to give back to others rather than someone who just closes down their torrent client once the download finishes so please try to seed to the ratio of 1:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e449e69a95e84099e90eb4a93309c36efccd81a9","amp;dn":"Louder%21+2012+-+Ministry+of+Sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e449e69a95e84099e90eb4a93309c36efccd81a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,73,230,154,149,232,64,153,233,14,180,169,51,9,195,110,252,205,129,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
