Here we have a huge array of torrents from Games to Audiobooks. We also do special requests by emailing me on SuprBay or commenting down below. Today we have the Game Lugaru. This is a fairly new game for mac about a rabbit that goes on a journey. There are several modes and you can progress in your skill, get more armour and whatever weapons there are get them. This game is only small and has no age rating. If you are scared that it is 'too violent' go into setting and turn blood off. There are also many other settings that can customize the game. Please note this is an authentic file I did not take it off anyone or steal it I was gifted it from my friend and this first-hand. \n\nCya Guys next time\n\n\n\nXav\nXavc.769 Torrents\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9601d5bcf640a7060e533f913979cc07ce8a09c3","amp;dn":"Lugaru+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9601d5bcf640a7060e533f913979cc07ce8a09c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,1,213,188,246,64,167,6,14,83,63,145,57,121,204,7,206,138,9,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
