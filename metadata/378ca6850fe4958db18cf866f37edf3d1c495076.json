But she plays a so particulary music. Mixing punk rock with folk russian music, Yanka Dyagileva have a great sound!\n That is the albun Anhedonia, from 1989. I hope you enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\nmore info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yanka_Dyagileva\n\nalbun cover: http://bayimg.com/PApapaAej","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:378ca6850fe4958db18cf866f37edf3d1c495076","amp;dn":"Yanka+Dyagileva+-+%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"378ca6850fe4958db18cf866f37edf3d1c495076","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,140,166,133,15,228,149,141,177,140,248,102,243,126,223,61,28,73,80,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
