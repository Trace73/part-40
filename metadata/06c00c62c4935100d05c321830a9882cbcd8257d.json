A double CD released on Water Records in 2005, the album mainly contains work originally recorded in the seventies as potential material for a third album on Asylum Records. A combination of Sill's health and drug problems and lack of interest in the market prevented the completion of the album in the seventies but a renewed interest in her work led to the release of this set.\n\nAll tracks by Judee Sill except where noted\n\nDisc 1\n\n&quot;That's the Spirit&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:18\n&quot;I'm Over&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:38\n&quot;Apocalypse Express&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n&quot;Living End&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n&quot;Things are Lookin' Up&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:17\n&quot;Good Ship Omega&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n&quot;Last Resort&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:33\n&quot;Til Dreams Come True&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n&quot;Living End&quot; (demo) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:08\n&quot;I'm Over&quot; (demo) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:20\n&quot;Til Dreams Come True&quot; (instrumental demo) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:24\n\nDisc 2\n\n&quot;Dead Time Bummer Blues&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:30\n&quot;Sunny Side Up Luck&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:06\n&quot;Emerald River Dance&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:10\n&quot;Waterfall&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:09\n&quot;North Country&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n&quot;Farmer's Daughter (The Chickens in the Garden)&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:10\n&quot;Wreck of the FFV (Fast Flying Vestibule)&quot; (Traditional) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:13\n&quot;500 Miles&quot; (Hedy West) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:01\n&quot;Oh Boy The Magician&quot; (instrumental) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:42","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c00c62c4935100d05c321830a9882cbcd8257d","amp;dn":"Judee+Sill+-+Dreams+Come+True+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c00c62c4935100d05c321830a9882cbcd8257d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,192,12,98,196,147,81,0,208,92,50,24,48,169,136,44,188,216,37,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
