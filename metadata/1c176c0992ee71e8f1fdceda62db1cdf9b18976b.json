It shows how the value\nof Free Software lies in its differences and creative challenges, as opposed to\nout-of-the-box and off-the-shelf solutions; how it allows to work and\ncollaborate differently with computers, and therefore enable different kinds of\nart and design.\n\nThe Internet - whose infrastructure is based on free software and open\nstandards - is an obvious example of such an adaptable, collaborative artistic\nmedium. &quot;FLOSS+Art&quot; also covers more traditional artistic domains such as\ngraphic and audiovisual design, and how they shift from customer-centric to\ncommunity-driven work.\n\n--\n\nABOUT THE BOOK:\n\nFLOSS+Art critically reflects on the growing relationship between Free Software\nphilosophy, open content and digital art. It provides first-hand insight into\nits social, political and economic myths and realities.\n\nWith contributions by: Fabianne Balvedi, Florian Cramer, Sher Doruff, Nancy\nMauro Flude, Olga Goriunova, Dave Griffiths, Ross Harley, Martin Howse, Shahee\nIlyas, Ricardo Lafuente, Ivan Monroy Lopez, Thor Magnusson, Alex McLean, Rob\nMyers, Alejandra Maria Perez NuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ez, Eleonora Oreggia, oRx-qX, Julien Ottavi,\nMichael van Schaik, Femke Snelting, Pedro Soler, Hans Christoph Steiner,\nProdromos Tsiavos, Simon Yuill.\n\nCompiled and edited by Aymeric Mansoux and Marloes de Valk.\nWith the support of the University of Huddersfield and the Willem de\nKooning Academy Rotterdam University. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://goto10.org/flossart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://goto10.org/flossart&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--\n\nABOUT THIS PACKAGE\n\nRather than just providing a &quot;free&quot; PDF, FLOSS+Art.v1.1.eBook-GOTO10 contains\nall the Fonts, Images, and Scribus source files that were used to make the\nbook.
