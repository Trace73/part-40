The seasoned five-person lineup clatters and bangs away with fire, though the focus is more on straightforward industrial-tinged rock, as opposed to full-on industrial banging and relentless sonic experimentation. Things fully fire after an alternating voice/noise &amp;quot;Prolog&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Feurio!,&amp;quot; one of the band's strongest singles. With an ominous death-disco rhythm stop-starting under it all, swirling wails and cries in the mix, and sudden guitar lines filling out the sound, Bargeld's declamatory vocal approach in full effect. It's perhaps one of the most &amp;quot;industrial dance&amp;quot; songs the group's ever done, but it feels like a logical conclusion of their sound rather than a sudden embrace of Wax Trax! esthetics. Equally impressive is the title track, starting with a soft chime before turning into a dangerously funky aggro-crawl. Much of the album's second half is taken up by the lengthy &amp;quot;Fiat Lux,&amp;quot; broken into three separate sections. Low in volume and astonishingly subtle until its final, overtly rhythmic conclusion, it's a testament to Einsturzende's abilities at the opposite end of where they are most often stereotyped as working, ambient instead of full-on noise. Bargeld's singing and a soft, central keyboard loop provides the main hooks for the piece, even when an array of random samples and noises starts surfacing about halfway through the track. Add in some blunt, interesting cover art and an appreciative essay from writer Biba Kopf , and Haus der Luege is another Einsturzende success. \n\n\nmer info:\nwww.neubauten.org\nwww.mute.com\n\n...hej folks!\nom intresse finns finns det mer E.N... :)\n\nPs. kommentera gÃƒÂ¤rna\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:433a96b7762e5ae3d8e5151ca32e818bcd0c0c94","amp;dn":"Einst%C3%BCrzende+Neubauten+-+Haus+der+Luege+-+1989","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"433a96b7762e5ae3d8e5151ca32e818bcd0c0c94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,58,150,183,118,46,90,227,216,229,21,28,163,46,129,139,205,12,12,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
