The brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll earned a fearsome live reputation wherever they played early on, and did more to further the cause of British techno in a live setting than anyone else. Live at Glastonbury is a two-CD/one-DVD audio-visual document of the duo's magic. The set is mixed to sound like one career-spanning set (although it was recorded between 1994 and 2004), and it includes nearly every one of Orbital's career milestones: &quot;Impact (The Earth Is Burning),&quot; &quot;Are We Here?,&quot; &quot;Attached,&quot; &quot;The Girl with the Sun in Her Head,&quot; and &quot;Walk Now.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ All Music Review by John Bush\n\n\n\n\nCD-01 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Walk Now\n[02] Are We Here\n[03] Attached\n[04] Kein Trink Wasser\n[05] Impact (The Earth Is Burning)\n[06] Remind\n[07] Halcyon\n[08] The Box\n\nCD-01 Play Time - 01h:13m:04s\n\nCD-02 - Track Listings\n\n[01] Style-Bagpipe Style\n[02] The Girl With The Sun In Her Head\n[03] Funny Break (Weekend Ravers)\n[04] Belfast\n[05] Frenetic\n[06] Satan\n[07] Dr Who\n[08] Chime\n\nCD-02 Play Time - 01h:05m:00s\n\nConcert Music Video Upload In My FLAC Torrent\n\n\nTotal MP3 Play Time............. 02h:18m:04s\nTotal File Size....................... 323mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
