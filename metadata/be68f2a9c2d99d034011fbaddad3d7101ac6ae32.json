Now that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s landed the assignment she intends to make it big, with feature articles on the front page of every sports section in the country. But to do that, she needs to score an interview with the most private and elusive athlete in baseball, PatriotsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ superstar Jake Miller.\n\nOn the rebound from a devastating injury that knocked him out of play for a season, Jake has a lot to prove to the suits in the head office. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure he still has what it takes to win, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be damned if he lets anything get in the way of his climb back to the top of the charts.\n\nThe last thing Jake needs is a pushy female reporter distracting him. But one look at Maddie and he knows heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in trouble. He finds himself trying for a different kind of play, one that involves bedrooms and not baseball stats. Sleeping together could damage both their careers, and Maddie is all about saying no. But when it comes to the game of love, Jake is playing to win.\n\n.\n\nBook 2 Hardball\n\nAfter years of hard work and keeping her nose firmly to the grindstone, Dr. Holly Bell has finally achieved her dream: a position as a pediatric surgeon at a prestigious teaching hospital. ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives rest in her skilled hands. That means total dedication to her work and her patients without letting anything or anyone get in the way. And a hot affair with a superstar athlete is most definitely getting in HollyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way.\n\nNate Carter, star pitcher for the Philadelphia Patriots, has the world in the palm of his baseball glove. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s at the height of his game, a west coast team is about to lure him with even greater riches, and the most gorgeous women in town are in full pursuit. Nate has everything he wants, or at least he thinks he does, until he meets the beautiful and brainy Dr. Holly Bell. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s totally up for a hot affair, and Holly turns out to be the hottest.\n\nBut will Holly be willing to play his game? When the lovely doctor starts changing the rules, Nate realizes he just might be playing for keeps.\n\nBook 3\n\nSports journalist Martha Winston loves her career, but her life goes sideways when she inherits a pro soccer team from her father. The team is almost bankrupt and on the skids, but Martha has vowed to save her beloved fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy. But she needs to get a financial infusion fast, or else lose the team to the wolves baying at her door.\n\nFormer British soccer hero Tony Branch wants to add MarthaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s team to his growing sports empire. But he wants it strictly on his termsÃ¢â‚¬â€full control, not a partnership. When Martha turns him down flat, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s determined to change her mind by any means necessary. If that includes using the sexual heat flaring between them, Tony is more than willing to play a game of seduction.\n\nBook 4\n\nTaylor Page has never wanted anything but a career in major league baseball. Through talent and guts, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finally landed a position as Assistant General Manager of the Philadelphia Patriots. But she wants the ultimate prizeÃ¢â‚¬â€General Manager. The only problem is that most men in baseball still donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take a woman exec seriously, especially a thirty-year old blonde with no on-field experience. She needs to do something big to convince her bosses she has what it takes to run a team.\n\nVeteran Pittsburgh outfielder Ryan LockeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career is in jeopardy when a suddenly unreliable throwing arm comes on top of rehab from a major injury. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s had a solid run but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a star with a mega-contract. A single parent with a troubled daughter and an alcoholic mother to provide for, retirement is out of the question. RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best hope is for a trade to an American League team as a designated hitter, allowing him several more years of play.\n\nWhen Taylor needs to find a replacement for an injured first baseman, she comes up with an innovative but risky idea: convince her boss to make a trade for Ryan Locke, and then convince the still talented slugger to play first base for the Patriots. With Ryan dead-set against that plan and both their careers on the line, neither Taylor nor Ryan can afford the explosive physical attraction between them. But despite TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best efforts to resist RyanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s campaign of seduction, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not sure sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got to willpower to keep from playing along","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be68f2a9c2d99d034011fbaddad3d7101ac6ae32","amp;dn":"Philadelphia+Patriots+series+book+1+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be68f2a9c2d99d034011fbaddad3d7101ac6ae32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,104,242,169,194,217,157,3,64,17,251,173,218,211,215,16,26,198,174,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
