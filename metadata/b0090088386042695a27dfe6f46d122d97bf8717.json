You've been trained to infiltrate, execute and assassinate with prejudice.\n\nWhile you'll have access to both Russian weapons and their German counterparts, it would be in your favor to kill in silence and arouse no suspicion from surrounding guards. Capturing enemy uniforms is paramount to infiltrating hostile territory since uniforms stained with Nazi blood will get you noticed and killed. Your choke cord and chloroform will be your best friends - know them well.\n\nThe enemy is not blind. You must be on your toes to remain unnoticed. They will raise alarms if you're spotted and the missions will require you to go far behind enemy lines. Remember, there will be no comrades to pull you out of the fire.\n\nYou are all alone and death comes easily to spies.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Mount or burn disc image DTS.iso;\n2) Run setup.exe and install the game (or use the autorun menu if it opens);\n3) Launch the game using its main executable or shortcuts (DRM free).\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0090088386042695a27dfe6f46d122d97bf8717","amp;dn":"Death++to++Spies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0090088386042695a27dfe6f46d122d97bf8717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,9,0,136,56,96,66,105,90,39,223,230,244,109,18,45,151,191,135,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
