I always enjoy looking at his books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs a side effect of the restoration process, depending on what you are using to view this file, you may need to reduce the image size a bit in order to achieve the best possible quality. On a smaller screen you'll never notice it, but if you are viewing on a full size monitor the file will open a bit too large. Just shrink it a bit and enjoy!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213288d66682cc72128822cbfde7648a3d3f1780","amp;dn":"Saloon+%28Underground+-+Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213288d66682cc72128822cbfde7648a3d3f1780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,50,136,214,102,130,204,114,18,136,34,203,253,231,100,138,61,63,23,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
