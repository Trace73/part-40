The Chemistry of Health\n\nThis science education booklet describes how basic chemistry and biochemistry research can spur a better understanding of human health. The booklet highlights the research of a number of chemists and includes questions at the end of each chapter.\n\nForward:\n\nHow could anybody fit all of chemistry into 66 pages? You&amp;#039;re skeptical that such a feat could possibly be accomplished, and with good reason. The Chemistry of Health cannot pretend to cover such an enormous area of science in so few pages. We wouldn&amp;#039;t even want to try. Instead, this science education booklet aims to offer a sampling of how basic chemistry and biochemistry research can spur a better understanding of human health. We also want you to witness the fascination of research alive in today&amp;#039;s chemistry labs.\n\nChemistry is anything but stale or static. Countless numbers of chemical reactions work ceaselessly inside your body, allowing you to think, breathe, and eat. Chapter 1, &quot;Actions and Reactions,&quot; aims to convey the essential and wondrous notion that the chemistry inside your body never stops. Cascades of repeating biochemical relays keep your organ systems operating smoothly and efficiently. Your body&amp;#039;s metabolic factories break down the food you eat and recycle the components back into basic building blocks from which your tissues and organs are built.\n\nScientists hunger for information since, like many others, they are curious people. But a key reason biological scientists strive to learn how living systems work is so they can redesign the broken metabolic circuits that contribute to many diseases. Chemists, like most biologists, want to learn how best to employ primitive organisms like bacteria and yeast, not only to probe fundamental biological questions but also to produce the valuable commodities we call medicines. Chapter 2, &quot;Harnessing Biology&amp;#039;s Magic,&quot; explores how biotechnology offers rich potential toward bettering human health....\n\n5. Escape Routes: For People Who Feel Trapped in Life&amp;#039;s Hell\n\nAfter decades of counseling, Johann Christoph Arnold still marvels at our capacity to make life miserable for ourselves and one another. This book, his tenth, points to a sure way out of life&amp;#039;s hells.\n\nUsing real-life stories, Arnold exposes the common seeds of loneliness, frustration, alienation, and despair, and gives you the tools to uproot them from your life. In contrast to the makeovers and quick fixes hawked by popular culture, Escape Routes offers a tougher prescription. The choices he presents are clear: &quot;to be selfish or selfless; to forgive or to hate; to burn with lust or with love; to defend your personal power, or dismantle it.&quot;\n\nWhy stake your hopes on some eternal hereafter, when you can taste heaven right here and now? No matter your problems, or who you are, this book will help you on your way, provided you&amp;#039;re ready to take its medicine.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ff5d4c0304e3130f6f9f3a78d008ec6f4ada29","amp;dn":"eBooks.%26.Magazines.September.17.07-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ff5d4c0304e3130f6f9f3a78d008ec6f4ada29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,255,93,76,3,4,227,19,15,111,159,58,120,208,8,236,111,74,218,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
