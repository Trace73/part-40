This series tackles four of these exploits, glimpsed through centuries-old literature and art, which were miraculously advanced for their time. Now, historians, technicians and artisans have come together to try to equal their forebears' genius and expertise and understand how these major achievements came about.\n\nPart 2. Fireship\nIn 674 AD the gates of Constantinople were under attack from the massed armies of the emerging Islamic world. It seemed as if the most prestigious city in Christendom was about to fall to the infidels, but then Constantinople unleashed a secret, new and highly powerful weapon: the fireship. Now two teams of specialists are aiming to recreate the fireship. It had on board two formidable weapons: a catapult and a flame-thrower. In France, one team re-build the catapult, with its complicated firing mechanisms; in the UK another team develop the pump system used to project the blazing oil. When the two teams meet up in a Maltese harbour to test out their work, results are, initially at least, somewhat mixed.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1800 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1024x576\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 49 mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 4\nPart Size: 680 MB\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf40e105a8aac7fc5a42f35eb465ca31da592752","amp;dn":"Ch4+Machines+Time+Forgot+2of4+Fireship+576p+HDTV+x264+AC3+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf40e105a8aac7fc5a42f35eb465ca31da592752","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,64,225,5,168,170,199,252,90,66,243,94,180,101,202,49,218,89,39,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
