But his journey to the\nHoly One is riddled by influence from an assortment\nof men: Zechariah, a grandfather of noble standing\nwho has fallen into drunkenness; Uriah, the High\nPriest whose lust for power forces him to gamble\nthe faith he proclaims; and Shebna, the Egyptian\nintellectual who guides Hezekiah's instruction.
