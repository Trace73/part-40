Above them is the houseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s owner, their daffy Aunt Dilys (played by Rosemary Leach) and below them, in the basement, lives the ever-smooth ever-competent Anton (Tom Goodman-Hill ('The Office', 'Spamalot')).\n\nIn the first episode, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time to decorate! The carpet hasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t been changed since the Sixties and thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s big holes in it - probably where someone dropped a lot of acid. And Milton discovers that &quot;Hint Of Apricot&quot; is a paint colour not a flavour of yoghurt. DoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop him having three bowls though... Episode 2 and Susan &amp; Ian are going on a second honeymoon - thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s if they can get Milton out of the boot of their car. And in the third episode, Susan &amp; Ian are planning an intimate dinner party for a few friends. &quot;Of course, the guests can always eat nibbles...&quot; - but unfortunately, Nibbles is the name of MiltonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hamster. Episode 4, and Milton discovers a strange kink in his bloodline which means heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the rightful Duke of Eastern Wales. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also given the keys to the city of Wrexham, mainly because no-one else wants them. Episode 5, and a bar of gold, a power drill and a pancake alarm combine confusingly as Milton accidentally holds up a bank and ends up on trial for his very freedom. If only he could stop giggling at the fact that the judge is secretly wearing a wig... And in the final episode, Milton tries to organize a party for his nephews, and somehow gets tangled up with a stampeding rhino, and a skywriting Spitfire...\n\n&quot;Milton Jones is one of BritainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best gagsmiths with a flair for creating daft yet perfect one-liners.&quot; (The Guardian.)\n\n&quot;If you havenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t caught up with Jones yet - do so!&quot; - (The Daily Mail)\n\nCast:\nMilton Jones as himself\nOlivia Colman as Susan\nNigel Lindsay as Ian\nRosemary Leach as Aunt Dilys\nTom Goodman-Hill as Anton\n\n\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Castle\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Dinner Party\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Honeymoon\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Retirement\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Robbery\nThe House Of Milton Jones - Twin's Party\n.\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76ca622647eca17d6ed9f1d3cd7ec796f5f22ccc","amp;dn":"The+House+Of+Milton+Jones+-+Series+01+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Sli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76ca622647eca17d6ed9f1d3cd7ec796f5f22ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,202,98,38,71,236,161,125,110,217,241,211,205,126,199,150,245,242,44,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
