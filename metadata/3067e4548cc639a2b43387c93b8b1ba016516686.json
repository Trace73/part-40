Although originally from Northern Ireland,              \n  vocalist/guitarist Gary Lightbody and bassist/keyboardist Mark            \n  McClelland first teamed up in 1994 at the University of Dundee, having    \n  relocated to Scotland to study at the esteemed college. The duo began     \n  composing music under several different band names, including &quot;Shrug&quot;     \n  and &quot;Polar Bear,&quot; before adopting the Snow Patrol moniker and enlisting   \n  Jonny Quinn to play drums in 1997. They signed with the U.K.&amp;#039;s Jeepster   \n  label in 1998 and released their debut album, Songs for Polar Bears, in   \n  August of that same year. The record was a large success across the       \n  U.K., where the bandmates also gained a large fan base for their live     \n  show.                                                                     \n                                                                            \n  The British trio graduated school and decided to relocate from Dundee to  \n  Glasgow in late 2000. Their second full-length, When It&amp;#039;s All Over We     \n  Still Have to Clear Up, was released in April 2001. Quickly thereafter,   \n  guitarist Nathan Connolly was added to the group, and Snow Patrol found   \n  themselves a deal with Polydor. Producer Chris Lord-Alge signed on for    \n  the release of Final Straw, which appeared stateside in April 2004. With  \n  the success of singles such as &quot;Chocolate,&quot; &quot;Run,&quot; and &quot;Spitting Games,&quot;  \n  Final Straw sold two million copies in their native U.K. and became the   \n  26th most popular British album of that year.                             \n                                                                            \n  Despite their growing success, founding member Mark McClelland left the   \n  band in March 2005, effectively downgrading Snow Patrol to a trio         \n  comprising Lightbody, Quinn, and Connolly. Shortly thereafter, however,   \n  former Terra Diablo bass player Paul Wilson and touring keyboardist Tom   \n  Simpson were permanantly added to the band. An opening slot on the        \n  European leg of U2&amp;#039;s &quot;Vertigo Tour&quot; followed in summer 2005, and Snow     \n  Patrol&amp;#039;s fourth album, the slickly commercial Eyes Open, arrived in May   \n  2006. That fall, with a successful run through North America under their  \n  belt and the mainstream appeal of &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; maintaining the band&amp;#039;s   \n  presence on American radio, Eyes Open was certified gold in the United    \n  States. Snow Patrol also became the first U.K. rock act in 13 years to    \n  break into the Top 5 of the Billboard singles charts.                     \n                                                                            \n                                                                                  \n\n  \n   [img]http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z150/rabbit48/take.gif[/img] [img]http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z150/rabbit48/bunnydancing.gif[/img][/color][/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3067e4548cc639a2b43387c93b8b1ba016516686","amp;dn":"Snow+Patrol-A+Hundred+Million+Suns-%28Advance%29-%28Rabbit48%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3067e4548cc639a2b43387c93b8b1ba016516686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,103,228,84,140,198,57,162,180,51,135,201,59,139,27,160,22,81,102,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
