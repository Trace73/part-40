He will then address specifically a broad based research of \ncrop circles and UFO's under the banner of 'Consciousness' and how they could be \none and the same in ways we have not hitherto considered. He will concentrate on \none of the strangest events he has witnessed in 26 years of research into the crop \ncircles - the Cheesefoot Head 'Entity' from 1989.  \n\nAlso addressed will be the removal of a document from his website that questioned his \nversion of the UK government's and Royalty's lack of involvement or interest in the \ncrop circles and demonstrate this as an example of how we could fall into the trap of \naccepting new open policies without scrutiny.\n\nThe Conference runs from 17-19 April 2009 in Washington D.C.

During this time I have interacted with \nBritish authorities on the subject at many different levels of government and Royalty. Ive been reporting on \nthese interactions during lectures, on tape and in books since 1989.  Recently a new and disturbing \ndevelopment has occurred. Officials are rewriting history as to the level of government interest and \ninvolvement with the mystery through the release from the National Archives of select or altered Military of \nDefence (MoD) documents.\n\nI first saw this in effect with an article written by Nick Pope, (above left) formerly head of the MoD-UFO \nproject. In his article Nick Pope claims that there was not substantial official interest or investigation in the \nsubject of crop circles by the MoD, Houses of Parliament, county police or the Royalty. In his article he \nspecifically claims that:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢        The MoD did not have an in-depth or lasting interest in the subject and he debunks many of the claims \nI have made regarding my government level interactions. Pope sites the Hansard record from the Houses of \nParliament as evidence that the Military have not worked with any civilian research group on the crop circles \nmystery.  I have proof that this is patently untrue which I will provide in this article.  \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢        Pope claims there was no involvement with county police and shows an official record from \nHampshire and Wiltshire police chiefs stating that their officers were not carrying out any official \ninvestigations.  This is misleading if not outright false and I will provide evidence to that effect.  \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢        Pope goes on to say that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhe had to denyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ any interest of the Queen or other members of the Royal \nFamily in the crop circles. I will provide personal letters I received from Her Majesty the Queen and Prince \nPhilip which show PopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s statement to be false.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢        Nick says that the use of a government ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ notice was never used to stifle media coverage of crop \ncircle events specifically those at Operation Blackbird. . A ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ notice is a government enforcement order to \ncease media transmissions of material considered to be a threat to national security.  Well known television \nand radio presenter Dave BarrettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s experience to the contrary is included in this article.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢        PopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s claims have been reinforced with the recent release of MoD National Archive records under an \nextension of the Freedom of Information Act. The media reported extensively on the records release and \nsome articles can be seen in Andrews new book. I know that these records are incomplete and in some cases \nfalse and will present the evidence in this report.\n\nI donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t believe the timing of Nick PopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s article and the MoD records release are coincidence. I can think of \nonly two explanations for the incomplete and wrong information in both.  Perhaps high level inter-\ngovernmental sharing of information on the subject has been on a need-to-know basis and not only the public \nbut Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Nick Pope were being misled. Or perhaps the government is trying \nto rewrite history and downplay their interest and involvement in the subjects of crop circles and UFOs using \nNick Pope to open the door to this approach. I wrote to Nick on September 15, 2006 disputing his version of \nevents.\n\nTo change the record on government involvement in the mystery requires that the record on my own \ninvolvement with the government be changed as well.   Fortunately I have proof of my claims. I can \ndemonstrate interest and interaction with local authorities in Wiltshire and Hampshire counties, the MoD, Nick \nPope at the UFO Project Department, members of Parliament and the Prime Minister Margaret ThatcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ncabinet, and the Royal Family.  Colin Andrews new book Government Circles has 192 pages of the most \nimportant historical documentation you were not intended to see about crop circles.\n\nFully supported by photographs taken by Police, Army and top secret aircraft of the Ministry of Defence.\n\n\nColin Andrews new book Government Circles was published on the 17 April 2009, the same day that he \nmade a major presentation about its contents at the X-Conference in Washington D.C.  The presentation was \ncovered and published by Michael Salla, Ph.D.\n\nOne week later Colin and Nick Pope appeared together 'live' on BBC radio in U.K. where Nick admitted that \nColin had produced &quot;Certain documentation which had shown that there was more military and Royal \ninvolvement than was apparent in his official report&quot;.  He went on to say that he wrote this while still \nemployed by the MoD and hence had to comply with their policy of down-playing the crop circles and indeed \nUFOs. Nick was asked, &quot;Well answer Colin's point that you are still sworn to the official secrets act and that \nyour old bosses are never far away and so if you knew the truth about all this, you could not tell us&quot;.  Nick \nreplied that he probably could not and admitted he had downplayed the subject.\n\nThe British newspaper The Western Daily Press also wrote about Colin's attempt to correct the MoD's \nversion of the Government and Royal involvement in the crop circles. The media worldwide is showing \nincredible interest.\n\nThe new book Government Circles published by Archive Publishing, sets the record straight once and for all \nwith full documentation and photographs - details never seen in public before, which includes evidence that \nthe government activated its top level censorship tool, a 'D-Notice' to turn off media coverage of strange \nevents surrounding the discovery of some new crop circles in Wiltshire, England in 1990.\n\n------------------------\n\nNickPope-ColinAndrews-BBCSolent-Sussex2009.mp3 (2.40mb)\n- http://www.colinandrews.net/Presentations.html\n\nColin Andrews delivered his first punch in New York last month at the Institute of Noetic Sciences, when he disputed \nthe British\nGovernments official statement regards involvement of the Ministry of Defence in crop circle and Ufo research. \nAndrews showed\ndocumentary evidence from his new book 'Government Circles' that they lied and consistently.\n\nPunch two came in Washington D.C. days later during a powerful presentation at the X-Conference where additional \nindisputable evidence was shown in the presence of the original government author, Nick Pope.\n\nA few days after the Washington event, on May 3rd, Andrews appeared live on BBC radio (side bar) with Nick Pope \nwhere during heavy questioning, Pope admitted that Andrews was right and effectively withdraw much of his original \ngovernment statement. The actual government position and involvement, as shown by Andrews are extremely important \nfor both the crop circles and UFO subjects and demonstrate why we need to be vigilant with the accuracy and \ntruthfulness of statements made by governments, EVEN during this 'so called' period of CHANGE and transparency. \nAndrews said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the truth we demand not version two of version one. We have to be sure that history is not re-\nwritten to distort the foundation on which full disclosure is made and also that it IS full disclosure when it comes - so \nfar it has NOT been, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s far from it&quot;.\n\n------------------------\n\nParatopiaep44 - Colin Andrews.mp3 (82mb) - Colin Andrews on Paratopia: November 27th, 2009 \n-\n\n\nThe man who coined the term ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcrop circle,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Colin Andrews, joins us tonight for an in-depth interview that seems to have a life of its own. Some of what that means happens during the show, and we take a time out to discuss it. Some of it continues to unfold privately as we post the episode.\n\nThree things are for sure:\n\n1.) This interview has triggered something in all three of us.\n\n2.) If you are like many and have completely disregarded crop circles as nothing more than hoaxes, you will change your mind after this interview.\n\n3.) The first two things are not hyperbole. For more on that, hereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Colin AndrewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ comments in his own words.\n\nJoin us tonight for this landmark episode of Paratopia. You wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t look at the subject the same way again.\n\n------------------------\n\nCOLIN ANDREWS to Speak at CSETI Contact Conference in Rio Rico, Arizona - October 24-26, 2009 \n\n\n- http://www.CSETI.org/contact\n- http://www.disclosureproject.org/EmailUpdateOctober62009.htm\n\n\n17 years after Dr. Steven Greer and Colin Andrews experienced an event which gave birth to the CSETI logo, Andrews reveals why that geometry has never left the radar screen.\n \n The CSETI emblem was chosen following a multiply witnessed large-scale interactive event which took place in England during 1992 with Dr. Steven Greer, Colin Andrews, and around 50 eyewitnesses. That geometry has continued to be a focus of AndrewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ research since that day, and at the conference he will show why he thinks the geometry is so key and is being communicated to us in such inexplicable modes.\n \n\nColin Andrews has decided to make public for the first time something which happened to him when he was a young child. Only AndrewsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ close family and his doctors have known about this until now.\n\nHe believes we must all step forward and risk ridicule, simply laying out the whole thing as it is, and not worrying about the conditioned social environment designed to contain and maintain the status quo. He hopes making this public will set an example and encourage others who have had similar experiences to come forward. \n\n\nColin Andrews - October 26 2009 - Interview at CSETI Conference.flv (12.6mb)\n - The Veritas Show: http://www.veritasshow.com/ \n\nA brief interview with the father of modern 'Crop Circle' research Colin Andrews.
