This Legacy edition brings together a remastered version of the original 24-track album, with a brand new, remixed and remastered edition of the rehearsal show (which was released separately in 1988 as Alternate Aloha). Additionally, the audio from a five-track audience-free private show, recorded in the early hours of the morning for broadcast on US TV, is included on the second disc.\n\n\nElvis was at pains not to duplicate much material from his Live At Madison Square Gardens shows that took place the previous year (released as Prince From Another Planet in 2012) and he was also keen to avoid material from his film Elvis On Tour which was doing brisk business, and would go on to win a Golden Globe. This lead to a set which included The BeatlesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Something, SinatraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s My Way, Johnny B. Goode and the rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ roll medley of Long Tall Sally/Whole Lot Of ShakinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Going On.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.elvis.com/news/detail.aspx?id=6833&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.elvis.com/news/detail.aspx?id=6833&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisc 1: The Ã¢â‚¬Å“broadcastÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ [second] show recorded January 14, 1973 (originally issued February 1973, as Aloha From Hawaii via Satellite, RCA 6089)\n\n01.
