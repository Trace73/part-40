Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Michael Jackson travel all over the world singing their biggest hits and going on wacky adventures as well. Following the success of &quot;The Beatles,&quot; ABC again used the formula for this series. Animated by Rankin/Bass (best known for their stop-motion holiday specials), the series was made at the height of psychedelic animation following &quot;The Yellow Submarine&quot; -- and each episode featured at least one song montage accentuated by dazzling visuals. Unlike the Beatles' series, the Jacksons were themselves participants in the creation. Michael, enamoured by being involved in fairy tales, was said to have given a lot of creative input. In the '80s, as Michael Jackson's popularity soared, this series was resurrected by many cable and network TV stations. In the '90s, while Michael was still known as &quot;the reigning King of Pop,&quot; the series was dusted off again for airings on MTV and VH1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c597f0bd1cb56828f8aa3fbddf2da56e1c84fc8","amp;dn":"Jackson+5ive+-++Season+1++-+1971+Animation+Michael+Jackson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c597f0bd1cb56828f8aa3fbddf2da56e1c84fc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,89,127,11,209,203,86,130,143,138,163,251,221,242,218,86,225,200,79,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
