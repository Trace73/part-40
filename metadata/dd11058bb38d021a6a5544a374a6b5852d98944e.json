However, the CD is filled with great songs, including a great balance of hip-hip songs (Throw Your Hands Up, Down with the Clique) and ballads (Age Ain't Nothing But a Number). Almost any of the songs on the CD could have been a hit single. That said, Aaliyah's voice was not as mature as it would be later, and some of the lyrics are a bit juvenile (if you're not down with my clique/ then you're poop on a stick).\n\nThe entire CD was produced by R. Kelly (he appears in the shadows on the CD back cover and is name-checked in several songs). With one producer, the CD sounds very cohesive, but it also is not as varied as her later CDs. It was rumored that she and R. Kelly were married at the time, even though she was only 15 years old. Her marriage seems to be addressed in the song, &quot;Age Ain't Nothing But a Number,&quot; which argues that she is wiser than her years would seem.\n\nAt times, the album sounds a bit dated (the CD &quot;One In a Million&quot; is much better). One of the lyrics states, &quot;Aalyiah's got a 90's swing,&quot; which is pretty accurate - the CD sounds very much like an early 90's hip-hp CD. Despite this complaint, I still greatly enjoy this CD. It sounds great and is a lasting tribute to Aaliyah's talent. We will miss out on hearing future recordings from this superstar, but will continue to enjoy the music she left behind.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd11058bb38d021a6a5544a374a6b5852d98944e","amp;dn":"Aaliyah+-+Age+Ain%5C%27t+Nothing+But+a+Number+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd11058bb38d021a6a5544a374a6b5852d98944e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,17,5,139,179,141,2,26,106,85,68,163,116,166,181,133,45,152,148,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
