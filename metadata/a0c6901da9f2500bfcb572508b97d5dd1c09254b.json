It's a huge collection: more than 400 works, focusing on the cult of the Virgin Mary. No instrumentation is specified, nor would have been, during this period. Micrologus provide their own choices, based on an intimate knowledge of music of the period.\r\n\r\nTransfers are made at 768 kBits/s, directly from the disc.\r\n\r\nBio enclosed.
