Baillie, &quot;Presbyterians in Ireland Today: Identity in the Twenty-First Century&quot;\nPublisher: Palgrave Macmillan | 2008 | ISBN: 1403912440 | PDF | 272 pages | 1.1 MB\n\nIn this investigation of Presbyterians and identity in modern Ireland, Baillie explores a wide range of contemporary topics based on over 115 interviews with Ministers and individuals from 25 congregations. Among other issues, she explores politics and culture; social and moral issues; roles of women; the influence of life history and geographical location; education; inter church relations; the Orange Order; Freemasonry; the ministry and the future. Do the institutions of the Presbyterian church help or hinder individuals in their lives? Baillie helps to demonstrate that identity is a key concept within the context of postmodernity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bed9ced8ef32b06e1207ac42de0798de4d1486a","amp;dn":"Presbyterians+in+Ireland+Today+_F1_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bed9ced8ef32b06e1207ac42de0798de4d1486a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,237,156,237,142,243,43,6,225,32,122,196,45,224,121,141,228,209,72,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
