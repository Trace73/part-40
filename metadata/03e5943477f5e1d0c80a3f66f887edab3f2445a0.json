Not bound by a western, Silicon Valley stereotype, this group of courageous and energetic doers has created a global and diverse mix of companies destined to become tomorrowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading organizations.\nWorthless, Impossible, and Stupid is about how enterprising individuals from around the world see hidden value in situations where others do not, use that perception to develop products and services that people initially donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think they want, and ultimately go on to realize extraordinary value for themselves, their customers, and society as a whole. What these business builders have in common is a contrarian mind-set that allows them to create opportunities and succeed where others see nothing. Amazingly, this process repeats itself in one form or another countless times a day all over the world.\nFrom Albuquerque to Islamabad, you will travel with Isenberg to discover unusual yet practical insights that you can use in your own business. Meet the founders of Grameenphone in Bangladesh, PACIV in Puerto Rico, Sea to Table in New York, Actavis in Iceland, Studio Moderna in Slovenia, Hartwell Metals in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, Given Imaging in Israel, WildChina in China, and many others. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be moved by the stories of these plucky start-upsÃ¢â‚¬â€many of them fueled by adversity and, more often than not, by necessity.\nGreat stories, stunning successes, crushing failuresÃ¢â‚¬â€theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all here. What can we, in the East and West, learn from them? What can you learnÃ¢â‚¬â€and what will these entrepreneurial stories, so compellingly told, inspire you to do?\nLet this book open doors for you where you once saw only walls. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever felt the urge to turn a glimmer of an idea into something extraordinary, these stories are for you.\n\n===================================================================================\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom Booklist\nIsenbergÃ¢â‚¬â€academic, entrepreneur, and consultantÃ¢â‚¬â€sets out to encourage readers to seek an entrepreneurial challenge, or what he calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“entrepreneurial choice,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ because while entrepreneurship is extraordinary, it is nonetheless possible. He also aims to redefine entrepreneurship Ã¢â‚¬Å“in terms of value creation and its capture, rather than business ownership per se.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The author sees important consequences of his new approach to entrepreneurship as he devotes chapters to income inequality and entrepreneurship, government and its influence on entrepreneurs, and his belief that youth and inventiveness are not requirements. With a wide variety of case studies and his global experiences with entrepreneurship, Isenberg concludes with characteristics of entrepreneurs. These include awareness of their own capabilities, as well as the information or assets necessary to capture extraordinary value, all of which lead them to face adversity and assume widespread risks in creating something valuable that is missing from the marketplace. This thought-provoking book will contribute to ongoing debates in the education of future entrepreneurs, those young and not so young. --Mary Whaley\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\nThere is a guy called Daniel Isenberg -- Worthless, Impossible and Stupid is broken into four parts and ...

The myth of the stroke of genius: most value creation is produced at the level of what Isenberg calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“minnovationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: small and unexpected twists on existing ideas, business models or products and services. 2. The myth of the expert: experts are not always the best positioned to be innovative. A noviceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fresh perspective can help to overcome barriers and discover opportunities that experts may be blind to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ Business Digest\n\nADVANCE PRAISE for Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid:\nBrad Feld, Managing Director, Foundry Group; cofounder, TechStars; and author, Startup Communities: Building an Entrepreneurial Ecosystem in Your CityÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid is a thought-provoking book for anyone interested in understanding the deeply contrarian nature of many entrepreneurs. It challenges the status quo definitions of entrepreneurship with substantive examples from all over the world. A must-read for building start-up communities.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJonathan Ortmans, President, Global Entrepreneurship Week, and Senior Fellow, Ewing Marion Kauffman FoundationÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Daniel IsenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bottom-up insights are a must-read for policymakers around the world racing to build smarter environments for starting and scaling firms.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEsther Dyson, Chairman, EDventure HoldingsÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid confounds the stereotypes. The book vividly illustrates that entrepreneurs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all look like Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg or Sergey Brin; they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all live in Silicon Valley. And most important, they do more than create start-ups that make novel products or solve problems; they build companies of lasting value.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJim McCann, founder and CEO, 1-800-Flowers.com and Celebrations.comÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Daniel Isenberg manages to turn the words Ã¢â‚¬Ëœworthless, impossible, and stupidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ into the highest form of praise by getting inside the minds of real-life entrepreneurs to explain how counterintuitive thinking (and a sometimes inexplicable indifference to failure) have helped create and often revolutionize global business.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nYossi Vardi, serial internet entrepreneurÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Daniel IsenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book sheds a whole new light on the nature of entrepreneurship, of entrepreneurs, and of business opportunity more broadly. Original, thought-provoking, and fun to read, it blows up a lot of truisms about this important topic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nLinda Rottenberg, cofounder and CEO, Endeavor GlobalÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Calling all contrarians: If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve taken great risks, confronted skeptics and setbacks, and unleashed extraordinary value, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll recognize yourself in this important new book by Daniel Isenberg. Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid perfectly captures the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial path, felling a great many myths along the way.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nCalestous Juma, professor, Harvard Kennedy School; author, The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in AfricaÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is a real threat to conventional theories on business development.

Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid accurately demonstrates why being an outstanding entrepreneur is not about age, expertise, or reason; it is about vision, courage, and mind-set.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAkin Ãƒâ€“ngÃƒÂ¶r, former CEO, Garanti BankÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“In this provocative book, Daniel Isenberg shatters stereotypes and clarifies the often misunderstood concept of entrepreneurship. His inspiring real-life examples prove that true value is often found where many can only see something that seems worthless, impossible, or stupid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSir Ronald Cohen, cofounder and former Chairman, Apax PartnersÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Valuable, practical, and insightful, Daniel IsenbergÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new book is a very helpful and illustrative guide to the entrepreneurial journey.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMaria Pinelli, Global Vice Chair of Strategic Growth Markets, Ernst &amp; YoungÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Entrepreneurship is so important for a healthy economy: It creates jobs, supports communities, and builds a better working world. Worthless, Impossible, and Stupid provides a sophisticated and provocative narrative on this crucial topic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nNick Lazaris, former CEO, KeurigÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Entrepreneurs take note. Daniel Isenberg makes his contrarian point clear in this provocative book: Entrepreneurs need to be as innovative in finding ways to capture value as they are in creating it. This will be good for them individually and for the society that benefits from entrepreneurialism.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMikko Kosonen, President, The Finnish Innovation Fund SitraÃ¢â‚¬â€\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Daniel Isenberg brings us back to the roots of entrepreneurship: ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about identifying, creating, and capturing value, in areas not seen by others and that may seem worthless, impossible, and stupid. But there are real rewards for the hard-headed entrepreneurÃ¢â‚¬â€and for the rest of us!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nDaniel IsenbergÃ¢â‚¬â€entrepreneur, professor, investor, speaker, and policy adviserÃ¢â‚¬â€is founding executive director of the Babson Entrepreneurship Ecosystem Project and Adjunct Professor at Columbia Business School.
