Spectral Dusk\n\nSpectral Dusk, the sophomore album from CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Evening Hymns, focuses on the loss of core member Jonas BonnettaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father and coming to terms confusion, frustration and emptiness that comes from losing a loved one. The record is in essence a heartfelt love letter from a son to his father filled with memories, heartbreak and healing. Spectral Dusk is a beautiful album and a few standouts include the contemplative Ã¢â‚¬Å“Asleep in the PewsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; the teary, broken steel guitar on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moon RiverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; the string arrangements on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Irving Lake Access RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; the anger on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Family TreeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and the tender hymn Ã¢â‚¬Å“Song To Sleep To.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If you are new to the Evening Hymns, this is a wonderful intro and gorgeous, heartfelt album well worth seeking out.
