I should have the rest up by the middle of April\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been a year since Hotachi disappeared, following his last clash with the black-ops organization Splinter. During that time, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leader, Velvet Black, has managed to establish a state of martial law throughput the City. But it has come at a high cost, for HotachiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former employers are now allied with their own greatest enemy, Dr. Arkoff. The goal of this unholy union is the creation of a new, invincible army of clones, an immortal master race. So far, the only resistance to SplinterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s takeover has been the rebel Black Dove faction, an underground network of freedom fighters. But without Hotachi, without a champion for their forces, and the citizens, to rally around, Black Dove doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stand a chance.\n\n\nEnjoy and seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:874d89b860d8d013e9aceda67c91bcf57d5d4a4b","amp;dn":"Samurai+%281988%29+Vol.+3++issue+001+Barry+Blair+Aircel+Comics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"874d89b860d8d013e9aceda67c91bcf57d5d4a4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,77,137,184,96,216,208,19,233,172,237,166,124,145,188,245,125,93,74,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
