Their sound was characterised \nby a hybrid of blues rock, hard rock and psychedelic rock, combining the psychedelia-themed \nlyrics, Eric Clapton's blues guitar playing, Jack Bruce's voice and prominent bass playing and \nGinger Baker's jazz-influenced drumming. The group's third album, Wheels of Fire, was the \nworld's first platinum-selling double album. Cream are widely regarded as being the world's \nfirst successful supergroup. In their career, they sold over 15 million albums worldwide\n\n\n   1. Cream - Live Cream Vol. I (MFSL UDCD 2-635) - N.S.U.              [10:15]\n   2.
