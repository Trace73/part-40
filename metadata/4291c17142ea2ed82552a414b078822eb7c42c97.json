I'm doing this because I can't seem to find any well seeded high quality releases of this series anywhere, which is a shame. I ripped them from the region 1 NTSC dvds using HandBrake and x264. I encoded them with a tune setting for preserving grain and a constant rate factor of 18. The video is left at its original resolution to preserve as much quality as possible. The audio is untouched and includes the English tracks as well as any commentary tracks. All subtitle tracks and chapter markers are intact. The file sizes are very non-standard/variable and usually large, but the quality should be top notch.\n\nThe other seasons will be released as I get done encoding them and finish seeding the previous season.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4291c17142ea2ed82552a414b078822eb7c42c97","amp;dn":"Angel.S01.NTSC.DVDRip.DD2.0.x264.CRF-OtakuLoser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4291c17142ea2ed82552a414b078822eb7c42c97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,145,193,113,66,234,46,216,37,82,164,20,176,120,130,46,183,196,44,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
