Vaughan may have been the new news, but King was not suffering, either. He had a world-class supporting band and was playing as well as he ever had. In other words, the stage was set for a fiery, exciting concert and that's exactly what they delivered. Vaughan was clearly influenced by King -- there are King licks all over his first two recorded efforts, and it was an influence that stayed with him to the end -- and he was unafraid to go toe-to-toe with his idol. King must have been impressed, since In Session never devolves into a mere cutting contest. Instead, each musicians spurs the other to greater heights. For aficionados of either guitarist, that means the album isn't just worth a listen -- it means that it's a record that sounds as exciting on each subsequent listen as does the first time through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1880868598aa689749f191eb01a9d215520b71a6","amp;dn":"Stevie+Ray+Vaughan+-+In+Session+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1880868598aa689749f191eb01a9d215520b71a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,128,134,133,152,170,104,151,73,241,145,235,1,169,210,21,82,11,113,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
