It has both the Germans and the Finns in it and describes operations from 1941 to 1944 when the siege was lifted. You find out about the first battles, like those done by Vatutin when he encircled the 8th Panzer division in 1941, something that might come as a surprise to many, and delayed Army Group North for 3 weeks. As well about the operations in 1942 and 1943 which restored the land link with the rest of the USSR yet the siege in and of itself would last until 1944. For those not too familiar with the Eastern Front this would be a great book, for those that want details of everything that happened within those 3 years, I would suggest waiting for Glantz's next book on Leningrad, a more indepth study. This book is also unlike the others of his that I have in that it has many pictures, exactly like his new &quot;Barbarosa&quot; book.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Siege-Leningrad-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304366722/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372702478&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+siege+of+leningrad+1941-1944+glantz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Siege-Leningrad-Military-Paperbacks/dp/0304366722/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372702478&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=the+siege+of+leningrad+1941-1944+glantz&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55d9e7ac215ac6362590c3bf5a7d76799af28917","amp;dn":"The+Siege+of+Leningrad+1941-1944%3A+900+Days+of+Terror","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55d9e7ac215ac6362590c3bf5a7d76799af28917","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,217,231,172,33,90,198,54,37,144,195,191,90,125,118,121,154,242,137,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
