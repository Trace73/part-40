It was created using Ubuntu 12.04/Brasero Burning software.  The file has been tested with success, but WARNING TO THE USER: It is un-patched.  You will need to patch it yourself -&gt; Without patching, it WILL run with glitches (mouse disappears during unit movement, etc).  This occurs on my original version of the disc as well\n\nThe Iron Blitz Edition differs from the original Axis &amp; Allies Board game in that it has several set-up scenarios. Early 1939, Cold war, etc.\n\nMore notes here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_%26_Allies_%281998_video_game%29)\n\nWindows users can use IMGBurn OS/freeware to burn the ISO to disc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad716c87a82be0ced17cfdeabcbe828e99ea338a","amp;dn":"Axis+%26amp%3B+Allies+-+Iron+Blitz+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad716c87a82be0ced17cfdeabcbe828e99ea338a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,113,108,135,168,43,224,206,209,124,253,234,188,190,130,142,153,234,51,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
