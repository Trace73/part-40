Terry Brown and Keri Brown describe this remarkable revolution in the study of historic and prehistoric biological materials, and provide the fundamental tools for studying the preserved or Ã¢â‚¬ËœancientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ biomolecules recovered from human, plant, and animal remains.\n\nA clear guide for students and an excellent resource for researchers, Biomolecular Archaeology illustrates a variety of analytical techniques taken from evolutionary biology, such as PCR, proteomics, and image analysis; and from chemistry, such as mass spectrometry and isotope analysis. With this new array of DNA evidence, the authors demonstrate how researchers can recover valuable information about the evolution of human societies and the environments in which we live.\n\nBrief Contents\nList of Figures xvi\nList of Tables xxi\nPreface xxiii\nPART I BIOMOLECULES AND HOW THEY ARE STUDIED 1\n1 What is Biomolecular Archaeology? 3\n2 DNA 9\n3 Proteins 38\n4 Lipids 54\n5 Carbohydrates 68\n6 Stable Isotopes 79\nPART II PRESERVATION AND DECAY OF BIOMOLECULES\nIN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS 89\n7 Sources of Ancient Biomolecules 91\n8 Degradation of Ancient Biomolecules 115\n9 The Technical Challenges of Biomolecular Archaeology 136\nPART III THE APPLICATIONS OF BIOMOLECULAR ARCHAEOLOGY 149\n10 Identifying the Sex of Human Remains 151\n11 Identifying the Kinship Relationships of Human Remains 168\n12 Studying the Diets of Past People 190\n13 Studying the Origins and Spread of Agriculture 210\n14 Studying Prehistoric Technology 236\n15 Studying Disease in the Past 242\n16 Studying the Origins and Migrations of Early Modern Humans 266\nGlossary 287\nIndex 302","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a62f38d5f0c71498f0b634c919ff1b622090ef66","amp;dn":"Biomolecular+Archaeology+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a62f38d5f0c71498f0b634c919ff1b622090ef66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,47,56,213,240,199,20,152,240,182,52,201,25,255,27,98,32,144,239,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
