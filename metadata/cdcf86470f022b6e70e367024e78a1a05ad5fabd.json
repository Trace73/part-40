(Korean: ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ‚Â³ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ã‚Â¤ ÃƒÂªÃ‚Â·Ã‚Â¸ÃƒÂ«Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â€šÂ¬!!) is a Flash cartoon series produced by a three-person team and hosted on the Korean website SamBakZa. The cartoons became particularly popular during the Spring of 2004 when it was exposed to American and European audiences, particularly for its classic manhwa style elements and its high quality of animation, in which the characters move lively and fluidly. The first There She Is!! generated a large amount of positive feedback from its online audience, including fan art, which drove SamBakZa to produce more cartoons in the series.&quot;\n-Wikipedia\n\n\n01.
