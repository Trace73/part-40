In time, the Sixth Gun-the most dangerous of the weapons-vanished. When the gun surfaces in the hands of an innocent girl, dark forces reawaken. Vile men thought long dead set their sights on retrieving the gun and killing the girl. Only Drake Sinclair, a gunfighter with a shadowy past, stands in their way. The Sixth Gun is a two-fisted adventure set in the mysterious and supernatural corners of the old west.\n\nThe Sixth Gun #25\nWinter Wolves: Part 2--Caught in the heart of a supernatural cold snap, Drake and Becky fight off a vicious creature intent on ripping them to shreds. Even the otherworldly powers of the Six seem ineffectual against a creature that can become one with the blizzard. Meanwhile, as Gord Cantrell hurries to find his friends, he encounters an old enemy-Kirby Hale.\n\nThe Sixth Gun #26\nWinter Wolves: Part 3--One wants to destroy the Six. One wants to steal them. Gord Cantrell knows better than to trust Kirby Hale. But together they embark on the strangest of journeys as they search for Becky, Drake, and the magical pistols they wield. Drake and Becky have problems of their own, though, as they are besieged by a legendary spirit-creature with a heart as cold as a winter storm. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7124703/The_Sixth_Gun_(1-20)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7124703/The_Sixth_Gun_(1-20)&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7261920/The_Sixth_Gun__21&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7261920/The_Sixth_Gun__21&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7279673/The_Sixth_Gun_22&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7279673/The_Sixth_Gun_22&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7434618/The_SIxth_Gun__23&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7434618/The_SIxth_Gun__23&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7590580/The_Sixth_Gun_24_(2012).cbz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7590580/The_Sixth_Gun_24_(2012).cbz&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2764fe4e7bf0985578c2d022766abd8a7aab3354","amp;dn":"The+Sixth+Gun+%2325-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2764fe4e7bf0985578c2d022766abd8a7aab3354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,100,254,78,123,240,152,85,120,194,208,34,118,106,189,138,122,171,51,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
