Previous high-energy singles like &quot;Vision Incision&quot; and &quot;Kool Roc Bass&quot; are included, along with new tracks like the surprising Hi-NRG/electro-fusion on &quot;Lazer Sheep Dip Funk&quot; and early-'80s funk reminiscent of Prince or Jamiroquai on &quot;Battle Flag&quot; (with Pigeonhed). On occasion, however, the Allstars' attempt at a varied sound backfires; &quot;I Used to Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;Vision Incision&quot; are harshly distorted urban ballads with sub-Liam Gallagher winging in place of vocals.
